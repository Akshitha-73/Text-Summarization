His concerns grew when a two-week family vacation resulted in a bill still running into the hundreds. This prompted him to explore solar power as an alternative. At the time, Chou’s electricity bills for his two-storey terrace house averaged between RM900 and RM1,100 per month. “Having tracked (electricity bills) consistently at RM1,000 or more per month and wondering why the bill was still so high (while away from home) during the vacation, it was time to look into investing in solar power as a long-term investment,” he said when contacted. About a month ago, he installed 27 solar panels and the accompanying system for RM34,000, significantly lowering his expenses. Although Chou is ineligible for rebates under the NEM 3.0 (Net Energy Metering) scheme, which has reached its quota, he still saves on electricity. “We’re not eligible for any kickbacks as the government’s NEM 3.0 (Net Energy Metering) quota is full, but we’re still saving on electricity as the bill is now around RM650-RM700 per month. “Once the quota is open and we get a slot, then we can look into getting returns on our investment,” he said when contacted. “The alternative was to keep spending money (paying electricity bills as usual), knowing it’ll increase in the future, so this was a good financial decision.”   Another homeowner, Muhammad Hazwan Yunus from Keramat, faced similar issues with monthly electricity bills of RM650 to RM700 and rising. He, too, had nine air conditioners at home and his situation was compounded by frequent family gatherings that spiked electricity usage, especially during weekends. Hazwan turned to solar financing and found companies which offers system installation with no upfront costs. Initially sceptical, he researched the concept and found it viable. “You rent the system with a meter installed, and the company charges you accordingly,” he said. “I took this substitution plan from Sols Energy and they installed the system, but now I have two bills. One to Sols, who charge 46 cents per kWh (Kilowatt-hours), and the other to TNB. “Now the TNB bill is around RM60 and the Sols bill is around RM420. I still save,” he toldMalay Mail. According to TNB’s bill calculator, homeowners consuming between 2,000 and 2,300 kWh monthly — leading to bills of RM1,000 to RM1,200 — would see their costs rise to RM1,300 to RM1,500 after adding the 8 per cent service tax. To understand how many kWh you’re using, clickthis link to TNB’s bill calculator. As of January 1, 2024, electricity prices in Malaysia are as follows: According to solar panel installersMalay Mailspoke to, for residential solar systems, the maximum capacity is 17 kWh, which can save households between RM950 and RM1,000 per month. A typical solar panel generates 400 to 500 watts, so a 22-panel system produces about 11 kWh. The cheapest installations cater to homes with RM200 to RM250 monthly bills, while the priciest systems target households with bills exceeding RM1,500. Meanwhile, prices for solar installations have dropped by 20 per cent. A vendor highlighted that the price of a 22-panel solar system has dropped from RM43,000 last year to RM36,000, thanks to improved panel quality and increased imports from China, which have contributed to these cost reductions. Abdul Wahid Ibrahim, an IT manager in Johor, installed a solar system in June to manage bills that exceeded RM1,000, especially during school holidays when his kids were around. He viewed solar power as a strategic investment for long-term financial stability. “The setup includes 23 solar panels, generating 12.65 kWp for a three-phase power supply. I have 23 panels and my TNB bill is RM20-40 now and the entire thing cost around RM23,000.   “I pay RM560 monthly (for the solar panels) through a credit card instalment plan and RM20 to RM40 to TNB. This is about RM600 monthly compared to RM800 to RM1,000 previously,” he said. Abdul Wahid expects to break even in under five years. “At the moment, NEM 3.0 is a ten-year term, but once I’ve cleared this credit card payment, I will pay only RM40 per month,” he said. Abdul Wahid said he preferred to pay for the system outright as he could break even faster than taking a seven- to 10-year plan with a company. “Since I installed mine, I’ve noticed three or four other households in my area doing the same. “Panel prices are generally lower now compared to a year ago, but there might still be some variation. Back then, solar panels was much more expensive,” he said. “If you calculate properly, it’s manageable, and you can break even. Some people think it’s expensive, but with payment schedules — say, using a credit card stretched to 50 months — it becomes much cheaper. “Unfortunately, many vendors only partner with banks for shorter terms, like 12 to 36 months. If they offered financing for 48 to 60 months, it would be much easier for most people,” he added. Malaysian Photovoltaic Industry Association (MPIA) president Davis Chong observed a significant uptick in installations, with major urban centres like the Klang Valley, Johor and Penang leading the charge, with growing interest in states such as Kedah, Melaka, Perak and Negeri Sembilan. Chong said homeowners can expect to see returns on investment within five to eight years, with some achieving payback even sooner. “Over a 25-year period (the typical warranty period for solar panels), homeowners can save significantly on their electricity bills. “For example, a system that costs RM45,000 to install could save an estimated RM90,000 over 25 years,” he toldMalay Mail. Davis also said financing options have expanded, with solar loans and innovative business models making installations more affordable. Programmes like NEM and the SolaRIS rebate offer financial incentives, further encouraging adoption. Technological advancements, including Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), is also making a difference, allowing homeowners to store excess energy for later use.   Some new housing developments are also pre-installing solar systems, easing adoption for buyers. “On top of that, I think P2P (peer-to-peer) energy trading is a really interesting development. This allows homeowners to sell their extra solar energy to others, creating a new way to earn money from their systems. “It’s a win-win because it makes solar (energy) more financially attractive and could encourage more developers to invest in residential solar (systems),” Chong added. Sols Energy spokesperson and teacher Raj Ridvan Singh said urban and suburban areas, especially in states like Selangor, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang, are experiencing significant growth in solar adoption. He added that government incentives, such as the SolaRIS RM4,000 rebate, have significantly reduced installation costs, making solar more accessible for homeowners. The NEM scheme, introduced by the Malaysian government, reduces reliance on TNB by allowing households to supply excess solar energy back to the grid in exchange for credits. When solar energy is insufficient or during the night when sunlight is unavailable, TNB will supply the energy to meet the household's needs. According to the Sustainable Energy Development Authority (Seda), the current NEMrakyatquota balance is 44.7 MWac, though applications is around ten times that at 405.3 MWac.

2024-12-03,Senior Perak cop’s hit-and-run trial: Witness says Ativa driver delayed exiting car after collision that killed student,https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/12/02/senior-perak-cops-hit-and-run-trial-witness-says-ativa-driver-delayed-exiting-car-after-collision-that-killed-student/158713,"IPOH, Dec 2 — The High Court here was today told that Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Mohd Nazri Abdul Razak did not get out of his car immediately after the road crash in which student Muhammad Zaharif Affendi Muhd Zamrie was killed. A teacher at Sekolah Menengah Jelapang Jaya, Azura Yusoff, 50, said the police officer only got down a few seconds later to walk towards the scene of the collision. She said she was on her way to pick up her 15-year-old daughter from Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Jati and arrived at the school grounds at 11.35am on December 15, 2023. The 16th prosecution witness said she parked her car behind a red Proton Saga near the main gate outside the school to wait for her daughter. “While I was in the car I heard a loud bang. I saw a car hit a motorcycle and the car’s right front and rear tyres ran over the motorcycle rider between the stomach and the chest,” she said. Azura said she was shocked to see the Perodua Ativa car collided with the motorcycle in front of the red Proton Saga car and honked her car when the (Perodua Ativa) driver did not get out of the car immediately after the collision. “A few seconds later, I saw the driver come out and walk towards the place of the collision. I can identify the driver. He was wearing a white T-shirt and black knee-length pants. “I was not sure what he did at the scene of the collision because I did not get out of my car,” she said when reading out her witness statement before High Court Judge Datuk Bhupindar Singh Gucharan Singh Preet here today. Meanwhile, Muhammad Shafiq Shamsul Kamar, 26, who is the 17th prosecution witness and owner of the motorcycle involved in the collision, told the court that the motorcycle, with its road tax and insurance not renewed since September 2023, was given to Muhammad Zaharif Affendi to be repaired. When cross-examined by lawyer Aiman Hakim Kamaruzzaman, representing Mohd Nazri, the technician told the court that he was not sure whether Muhammad Zaharif Affendi had the skills to repair motorcycles. Another prosecution witness, who is the technician’s younger brother, said he handed over the motorcycle to  Muhammad Zaharif Affendi, who was good at modifying motorcycles, to make some modifications to it. “The day before the incident, I met Zaharif at his house and Zaharif asked me if he could change the motorcycle exhaust and I agreed to it,” he said, and also told the court that the brakes and rear lights on the motorcycle had been repaired before the collision. The prosecution was conducted by deputy public prosecutors Afzainizam Abdul Aziz, Nasrul Hadi Abdul Ghani, V. Suloshani and Low Qin while lawyers M. Athimulan and Datuk Mior Faridalathrash Wahid also represented Mohd Nazri. The hearing continues tomorrow. — Bernama "

The threat comes after exhaustive diplomacy by outgoing President Joe Biden’s administration that has so far failed to secure a deal that would both end Israel’s war in Gaza and free hostages seized 14 months ago. “If the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!” Trump has vowed staunch support for Israel and to dispense with Biden’s occasional criticism, but has also spoken of his desire to secure deals on the world stage. Hamas staged the deadliest ever attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. The assault resulted in 1,208 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Militants seized 251 hostages during the attack, some of whom were already dead. Of those, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 35 the army says are dead. Israel’s retaliatory campaign has killed 44,429 people in Gaza, according to figures from the territory’s health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable. — AFP  "

Hulu Terengganu police chief DSP Zainul Mujahidin Mat Yudin said that this action was taken because authorities found that some drivers were still attempting to use the road despite clear road closure signs being posted. ""We found that some members of the public were stubbornly risking their safety by trying to use the road, even though part of it had collapsed. The police are very concerned about this, and we hope that with the concrete barriers placed by the Public Works Department (JKR) of Hulu Terengganu, no drivers will try to access the road,"" he told Bernama. He added that the road is expected to remain closed for an extended period for repairs, as the landslide, which spans 100 metres, is quite severe. Yesterday, a video went viral on social media showing a four-wheel drive attempting to pass through the area, despite the land subsidence and landslides present. In a separate development, Zainul Mujahidin reminded residents of Hulu Terengganu, particularly those living near hillside slopes and cliffs, to remain vigilant and alert to their surroundings during the Northeast Monsoon season. ""During rainy weather, if you notice a small waterfall appearing on a hillside that wasn't there before, residents should pay attention and report it to the relevant authorities, as well as evacuate to a temporary relief centre (PPS) or a safer area. This could indicate a potential landslide. It's not just flood situations that require evacuation,"" he said. Last Friday, two siblings lost their lives while another was injured in a landslide that occurred at a house in Kampung Bukit Apit, Ajil, near Hulu Terengganu. — Bernama "
2024-12-03,"Najib says ‘still clueless’ over alleged personal interest in RM60M power abuse charge, insists he was just doing his job",https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/12/02/najib-says-still-clueless-over-alleged-personal-interest-in-rm60m-power-abuse-charge-insists-he-was-just-doing-his-job/158708,"KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 2 — Former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak today denied having any personal interest in getting a government guarantee in 2009 for a RM5 billion debt in the form of bonds by 1Malaysia Development Berhad’s (1MDB) predecessor Terengganu Investment Authority (TIA) Berhad. In his 1MDB trial, Najib is facing 25 charges, including four charges of abusing his power in three roles — as prime minister, finance minister, and 1MDB’s board of advisers’ chairman — over 1MDB matters for his own financial benefit amounting to RM2.27 billion. Under the first power abuse charge, then-finance minister Najib is alleged to have misused his position on April 1, 2009 to get the Cabinet’s consent — through a Finance Ministry memorandum to the Cabinet — for the RM5 billion government guarantee to TIA. Under this first charge, Najib is accused of doing this for his own financial benefit of RM60.6 million. But Najib, 71, told the High Court here that he still does not know what personal interest he is alleged to have in this 2009 matter, and insisted that he was merely carrying out his job as the finance minister then. “To this day, my lawyers and I are still left to speculate on precisely what this supposed interest might be, is it in TIA, in Goldman Sachs, in the IMTN, in Ambank or in MBTI?” he said when testifying in his own defence. Najib was referring to the Islamic bonds or Islamic medium term notes (IMTN), TIA’s Islamic bonds financial advisor Goldman Sachs, TIA’s Islamic bonds arranger AmBank, and TIA’s owner Menteri Besar Terengganu Incorporated (MBTI). “I’m still clueless,” he added, after saying that the first power abuse charge did not specify what personal interest he had. “It seems we’re expected to engage in a guessing game rather than being presented with any specificity. We were and still are flying blind within the territory of this personal interest alleged against me,” he said. Explaining the April 1, 2009 Cabinet meeting chaired by then prime minister Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, Najib earlier today said he was just carrying out his “official duty” as the then finance minister when he presented the Finance Ministry memorandum for the RM5 billion government guarantee. Najib said that he was merely carrying out the Cabinet’s instructions from its previous December 12, 2008 meeting in his capacity as finance minister, when he tabled the memorandum. “So, I had no ulterior personal motive in the presentation of the memorandum which was directed by the same Cabinet in the first place. “It goes without saying that I also do not have any personal interest to declare in the government guarantee to be extended to TIA, an entity controlled by the state of Terengganu,” he said. Najib stressed that his presenting of the memorandum to the Cabinet was not an abuse of his official position as finance minister, but was merely him discharging his official duty under his ministerial portfolio under the Cabinet’s instructions. Among other things, Najib today described the 1MDB trial against him as a “political prosecution”, claiming that he has been “extremely prejudiced” as investigators had allegedly not asked him to address the allegations of personal interest. Najib said this meant he did not have the chance to get investigators to understand his version of facts before a decision was made on whether to charge him, and said he would not get a fair hearing without a fair investigation. “This rush to charge me is yet another indication that the charges against me are politically motivated,” he claimed. Najib disagreed with the approach of charging an accused person first and only giving him the opportunity to explain later during trial through cross-examination, and that he hopes this alleged “injustice” ends with him. This morning, Najib did not start his trial with an opening statement, but went straight to reading out his 525-page witness statement. In the afternoon, Najib was heard coughing occasionally while testifying. Najib’s 1MDB trial before judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah resumes tomorrow morning.     "
2024-12-03,"Penang High Court awards RM400,000 to CM Kon Yeow in his defamation suit against tycoon Tan Kok Ping",https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/12/03/penang-high-court-awards-rm400000-to-cm-kon-yeow-in-his-defamation-suit-against-tycoon-tan-kok-ping/158744,"GEORGE TOWN, Dec 3 — The Penang High Court has awarded Penang Chief Minister Chow Kon Yeow with RM350,000 in damages and RM50,000 in costs in his defamation suit against Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce life honorary president Tan Sri Tan Kok Ping. Penang High Court Judge Datuk Quay Chew Soon said Chow, as the plaintiff, has successfully proven his case for defamation against the defendant, Tan. He found that Chow’s suit had satisfied all three elements in defamation, in that the impugned statement made by Tan had referred to Chow, that the statements were defamatory and that the statements were published. “It is also my findings that the defences of justification, fair comment and qualified privilege were not proven and I find the defendant had acted with malice and was not entitled to rely on fair comment or qualified privilege,” he said. He said the defamatory statement, that was uttered in Mandarin, lies in three words that translated to mean incompetent, ignorant and shameless. “The plaintiff is the chief minister of Penang and must be perceived as capable and intelligent in the performance of his duties, he must command respect from the people of Penang,” he said when reading out the grounds for his judgement. He said when an influential figure like Tan accused Chow of being incompetent, ignorant and shameless, it has the propensity to smear Chow’s reputation. He also said that whatever the reasons Tan had to call a press conference on October 18 last year, there was no cause for Tan to single out Chow for public humiliation by describing him with those three words. He said the press conference was on the joint development agreement (JDA) of the BKIP2 project but at the time of the press conference, the JDA was already terminated and the BKIP2 project had ceased to exist. “Therefore, public interest was not served when it was on something that does not exist and this statement was not made on a privileged occasion as the public has no legal or moral duty of being informed of a non-existent project,” he said. While he said there was a project and there were a lot of questions circling the project, at the end of the day, the JDA was terminated and the project had ceased to exist. Quay said the Penang Development Corporation (PDC) had embarked on a different approach for the project so it was time to move on and not be saddled with the past. He also found that Tan’s anger towards Chow regarding the Silver Jubilee Home issue had never subsided. “Hence, when the opportunity arose for him to publicly humiliate the plaintiff, in respect of an issue which was unrelated to the Silver Jubilee fund, the defendant seized it,” he said. He said a parallel can be drawn between what Tan said in his resignation letter from the Silver Jubilee trustee board and in his statement in the press conference made four months later. “In essence, both amounted to a scathing attack on the character of Chow in his position as chief minister,” he said. He said the circumstances under which Tan’s resignation letter was written might be different from the press conference but the nature of attack in both instances is the same. “The attack is directed at the competency of the plaintiff as the chief minister, the statement made at the press conference and at paragraph 11 of the resignation letter bears similar connotations, thus when the defendant uttered the impugned statement, it is not wrong to postulate that he was echoing what was said four months earlier in his resignation letter,” he said. In Chow’s suit, he had asked for damages of RM300,000 for each publication of the impugned statements made by Tan which totalled to RM2.1 million. Quay said he is not in favour of making separate awards for each publication so he is awarding global damages of RM350,000 to Chow with interests of five per cent per annum from the date of judgement. “In line of giving a single award, I won’t make a separate award on aggravated damages and exaggerated damages is not warranted as the defendant did not make the statement to enrich himself,” he said. He also awarded Chow RM50,000 in costs. “On apology, I decline to use my discretion to make an order as to forcing a public apology,” he said. He said there was no indication from the defendant of any willingness to apologise and that a willingness to apologise should be sincere and conceived in a contrite heart. “It is counterproductive to force an apology when he’s steadfast in his stance that the wrong he did was supposedly right,” he said. Chow had filed the defamation suit against Tan after the latter made those remarks in a press conference regarding the proposed development project between PDC and Umech Land Sdn Bhd. PDC had announced the termination of the JDA with Umech Land before Tan called the press conference where he called Chow incompetent, ignorant and shameless in Mandarin. Tan’s remarks were published in six Chinese newspapers and one English daily. "
2024-12-03,Beat the rainy season blues with fresh Teochew seafood porridge and bouncy fish balls at Ang Mo Kang in Cheras,https://www.malaymail.com/news/eat-drink/2024/12/03/beat-the-rainy-season-blues-with-fresh-teochew-seafood-porridge-and-bouncy-fish-balls-at-ang-mo-kang-in-cheras/158726,"KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 3 – With the year end downpour, we have been feeling a tad chilly. Nothing better, really, than something soupy to warm us up and beat the rainy season blues. Something soupy or perhaps porridge? This is the star attraction at Ang Mo Kang Sekinchan Restaurant in Taman Bukit Segar, Cheras. Their Teochew style fish or seafood porridge, made with whatever is freshly caught and delivered directly from Sekinchan – hence the name. When asked, the manager shared with us that Ang Mo Kang is another name for Sekinchan, a small town in north-west Selangor. Famed for its paddy fields, Sekinchan is also a major fishing village so it is also known for its fresh seafood.   Indeed there are many seafood restaurants in Sekinchan, a whole row of them facing the fishing jetties. Most of the villagers and fishermen are Teochew so this cuisine is predominantly identified with how locals prepare their seafood. The draw at Ang Mo Kang, then, is for KL-ites to enjoy fresh Sekinchan seafood and Teochew style home cooking without making the two-hour, 100-kilometre drive to the fishing village itself. Regulars can choose from a variety of fish for their Teochew Fish Porridge, from the more popular grouper and pomfret to threadfin and red snapper. Clams are also available for those who prefer a more mollusc-forward porridge.   If you can’t make up your mind, a conundrum we often face, then do as we usually do in such circumstances and go for a mix. We went for a Teochew Mixed Seafood Porridge that included prawns and squid. For the mixed option, you can choose either grouper or pomfret for your fish component. While each bowl is cooked to order, the wait isn’t long to ensure the seafood isn’t overcooked. Our morsels of grouper were utterly tender without being mushy, a sign that fresh rather than frozen seafood is used. There isn’t the usual fishy smell, another sign of freshness. The prawns certainly stood out here, each still retaining a beautiful snap when we bite into the juicy sweet flesh. The broth was light but flavourful, enriched by the assortment of seafood with only a few strands of julienned young ginger needed to balance it. What a bowlful of comforting goodness!   If the seafood porridge served to nourish us, then the other dishes we chose were purely for pleasure. We had asked the manager for his recommendations and he suggested the Fried Chilli Shrimp and Fish Ball Soup. To be quite honest, the Fried Chilli Shrimp didn’t look like much when the server placed the dish on our table. Perhaps the dimensions were unhelpful; a large platter and a scattering of stir fried shrimps on a couple pale leaves of lettuce. Looks can be deceiving. Though the shrimps appeared diminutive in size (they have been stir fried after all) and far from fiery red in colour, they really packed a punch in terms of flavour and heat. These are addictive, so good we mostly ate them on their own without needing the accompaniment of a spoonful of porridge.   As tempted as we were to order another round of the spicy Fried Chilli Shrimp, we were glad we didn’t because our order of Fish Ball Soup was quite filling. These are available as bowls of five or 10 handmade fish balls. We went for the second option, so five bouncy fish balls each. Every bite had that desired “QQ” chew. More fish than filler, so we ate without guilt. Other recommended dishes include the Fried Clam Beehoon, Ginger Duck Porridge and Fried Fish Cake, but we really didn’t have space for more. Maybe next time. The space itself was clean and minimalist. Simply furnished. Besides the tables and chairs, there was nothing more in terms of décor beyond a row of posters showcasing the signature dishes.   Then again, when the food is this fresh and well prepared, you don’t really need fancy baubles and trimmings to draw customers into your shop. Word of mouth and consistent quality will keep regulars returning again and again. We certainly will come back.

Well, Jon Collins-Black is making that dream a reality — but with a twist. His new book,There’s Treasure Inside, isn’t just a fun read; it’s a treasure map that’s sending adventurers across the United States on a thrilling quest to find five hidden chests, each containing riches worth over US$2 million (RM9 million). Collins-Black, a lifelong fantasy fan who grew up immersed in games likeDungeons & Dragons, told CNN that he has always been fascinated by the idea of treasure hunts. By 2015, after a successful career as a musician and entrepreneur, he was ready for a new challenge. Inspired by Forrest Fenn’s famous 2010 treasure hunt, Collins-Black set out to create something that would ignite the imagination of treasure seekers nationwide. “I wanted to have the chests spread out to give people the optimistic, adventurous possibility,” Collins-Black explained to CNN. Instead of a single hidden chest tucked away in the mountains, he envisioned multiple chests spread across the country, offering everyone a chance to get close to the treasure. Each chapter ofThere’s Treasure Insideholds detailed clues leading to one of the chests, and while Collins-Black isn’t spilling the beans on specifics, he assures readers that all the clues needed to find the treasure are in the book itself. To keep things under wraps, Collins-Black worked with as few people as possible. Even his wife didn’t get the scoop. “I couldn’t really consult other people because I didn’t want them to have the burden,” he was quoted as saying by CNN. It was a massive undertaking, and Collins-Black admits he had to experiment with the difficulty level of the clues through trial and error, but the result is a hunt that promises to challenge even the most dedicated treasure hunters. As excitement builds, thousands of treasure seekers are already gathering online, discussing theories and speculating on where the treasure might be hidden. Some are even convinced they’ve pinpointed the states where the chests are located. But don’t worry — this hunt is designed to be safe for all adventurers. No dangerous diving, climbing, or trespassing required. The sites are accessible to those in average health, and no digging is necessary. For Collins-Black, it’s all about fun — but don’t expect a treasure hunt that lasts for decades. “I do hope and think it might take a little while, but I don’t need this to take forever,” he told CNN. If the chests remain unfound, he may release more clues, or even write a sequel to keep the adventure alive. So what exactly is hidden inside these chests? Collins-Black carefully curated the treasures, working with historians and attending auctions to gather a one-of-a-kind collection. He even financed the pieces with money he saved from early bitcoin investments. Inside the chests, treasure hunters will find everything from rare Pokémon cards and shipwreck bounty to sports memorabilia, gold, and precious medals. There are even items with deep historical significance, like artefacts from Pablo Picasso, George Washington, Amelia Earhart, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. While it’s tough for Collins-Black to pick a favourite, a few items stand out: a brooch once owned by Jackie Kennedy Onassis, a 96-carat emerald, and Wilma Rudolph’s 1960 Olympic gold medal. One item that didn’t make the cut, though, was an Albert Einstein pipe — Collins-Black lost it in a bidding war. To make things even more exciting, one chest has been made larger and more valuable than the others, raising the stakes for anyone brave enough to hunt it down. So will you be the one to find the grand prize? Time to start the hunt!"
2024-12-03,Do not pass go: Elon Musk loses bid to restore US$56b Tesla pay package,https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2024/12/03/do-not-pass-go-elon-musk-loses-bid-to-restore-us56b-tesla-pay-package/158719,"WILMINGTON (Delaware), Dec 3 — A Delaware judge ruled yesterday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a US$56 billion (RM250 billion) compensation package despite shareholders of the electric vehicle company voting to reinstate it. The ruling by the judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, follows her January decision that called the pay package excessive and rescinded it, surprising investors, and cast uncertainty over Musk’s future at the world’s most valuable carmaker. Musk did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company’s driving force who is responsible for many of its advances and reinstate his compensation. McCormick said Tesla’s board was not entitled to hit “reset” to restore Musk’s pay package. “Were the court to condone the practice of allowing defeated parties to create new facts for the purpose of revising judgments, lawsuits would become interminable,” she said in her 101-page opinion. She also said Tesla made multiple material misstatements in its proxy statement regarding the vote and could not claim the vote was a “cure-all” to justify restoring Musk’s pay. “Taken together,” the problems with Tesla’s arguments “pack a powerful punch,” she wrote. Tesla shares fell 1.4 per cent in after-hours trade, after the ruling. McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the case US$345 million, well short of the US$6 billion they initially requested. She said the fee could be paid in cash or Tesla stock. “We are pleased with Chancellor McCormick’s ruling, which declined Tesla’s invitation to inject continued uncertainty into Court proceedings,” said a statement from Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, one of the three law firms for the plaintiff. The law firm also said it looked forward to defending the court’s opinion if Musk and Tesla appealed. Musk and Tesla can appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court as soon as McCormick enters a final order, which could come as soon as this week. The appeal could take a year to play out. After the January ruling, Tesla shareholders flooded the court with thousands of letters arguing that rescinding Musk’s pay increased the possibility he would leave Tesla or develop some products like artificial intelligence at ventures other than Tesla. Attorneys for shareholder Richard Tornetta, who sued in 2018 to challenge Musk’s compensation package, had argued that Delaware law does not permit a company to use a ratification vote to essentially overturn the ruling from a trial. McCormick in January found that Musk improperly controlled the 2018 board process to negotiate the pay package. The board had said that Musk deserved the package because he hit all the ambitious targets on market value, revenue and profitability. But the judge criticized Tesla’s board as “beholden” to Musk, saying the compensation plan was proposed by a board whose members had conflicts of interest due to close personal and financial ties to him. After the January ruling, Musk criticised the judge on his social media platform X and encouraged other companies to follow the lead of Tesla and reincorporate in Texas from Delaware, although it is unclear if any companies did so. The judge in her January ruling called the pay package the “biggest compensation plan ever - an unfathomable sum.” It was 33 times larger than the next biggest executive compensation package, which was Musk’s 2012 pay plan. As of yesterday, the pay package was worth US$101.4 billion, according to Equilar, a compensation consulting firm. Musk’s 2018 pay package gave him stock grants worth around 1 per cent of Tesla’s equity each time the company achieved one of 12 tranches of escalating operational and financial goals. Musk did not receive any guaranteed salary. Tornetta argued that shareholders were not told how easily the goals would be achieved when they voted on the package. — Reuters  "

2024-12-03,BBC urged to pull ‘MasterChef’ off-air amid sexual harassment claims against presenter Gregg Wallace,https://www.malaymail.com/news/showbiz/2024/12/03/bbc-urged-to-pull-masterchef-off-air-amid-sexual-harassment-claims-against-presenter-gregg-wallace/158721,"LONDON, Dec 3 — The BBC faced pressure yesterday to take one of its most popular and long-running shows, “MasterChef”, off air following claims one of the programme’s presenters engaged in sexually harassing behaviour. Presenter Gregg Wallace has denied making “inappropriate” sexual jokes and comments after more than a dozen people came forward last week with allegations spanning a 17-year period. But he was forced into making a new apology on yesterday for his remarks. The furore is the latest scandal to hit the taxpayer-funded British broadcaster. Another prime-time show, “Strictly Come Dancing”, was thrown into crisis this year amid bullying accusations. And former top news anchor, Huw Edwards, pleaded guilty in July to making indecent pictures of children, narrowly avoiding jail in a stunning fall from grace. The production company behind “MasterChef”, a decades-old show aired on the BBC whose branded format is now produced in more than 50 countries, has said it is probing the claims against Wallace. It also announced that Wallace would stop presenting while it investigates, but that the current recorded season of “MasterChef: The Professionals” would continue to air. The allegations against Wallace emerged from a BBC News investigation which also reported the broadcaster had warned the presenter after a complaint was made in 2018. Wallace sparked a further backlash over the new claims when he said in a video posted Sunday that they had been made by “a handful of middle-class women of a certain age”. Wallace apologised yesterday for “any offence that I caused” with those comments. One of his accusers had said they showed he “clearly hasn’t learnt his lesson”. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s spokesman told reporters Wallace’s comments were a “completely inappropriate and misogynistic” response to the “deeply concerning” claims. The spokesman noted Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy held talks with BBC bosses last week “to seek assurances that there are robust processes in place to deal with complaints”. The broadcaster is conducting an independent review into workplace culture which Starmer’s spokesman said “must deliver clear and timely recommendations”. Earlier yesterday Labour MP Rupa Huq, a member of parliament’s watchdog Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said the BBC should consider not airing the current season as well as upcoming Christmas episodes. “I think possibly there is an argument for pausing while this investigation takes its course,” Huq told BBC radio, adding the broadcaster “should send a strong signal [about] this sort of behaviour”. Wallace’s lawyers have said “it is entirely false that he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature”. A BBC spokesperson said it had “robust processes” to deal with complaints “swiftly and appropriately” and added it “will always listen if people want to make us aware of something directly”. — AFP"

Those going to the December 10 ceremony will include group co-chair Terumi Tanaka, 92, who witnessed the 1945 Nagasaki bombing as a child, as well as other survivors and their children. With money provided by the Nobel Committee not enough to cover the travel expenses of such a large delegation, the group launched a crowd-funding campaign, which has so far raised over 36 million yen (RM1.07 million). Hidankyo member Jiro Hamasumi, 78, told reporters on Monday that the group was “very surprised” that the campaign raised 10 million yen on the first day alone. “I’m delighted to say that our delegation will be able to go,” Hamasumi said. He was in his mother’s womb when the United States dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. His father, who was at work just a few hundred metres (yards) from the epicentre, was killed. “I hope I can speak from my own experience (in Oslo) about our desire not to see another victim, and that nuclear weapons must never be used,” Hamasumi said. The grassroots anti-nuclear organisation was established in 1956 and is the only nationwide association of A-bomb survivors, who are known as hibakusha. The Norwegian Nobel Committee nominated Nihon Hidankyo “for its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons and for demonstrating through witness testimony that nuclear weapons must never be used again”. Around 140,000 people died in Hiroshima and 74,000 others in Nagasaki three days later on August 9, 1945. Survivors suffered from radiation sickness and longer-term effects including elevated risks of cancer. The bombings, the only times nuclear weapons have been used in history, were the final blow to imperial Japan and its brutal rampage across Asia. It surrendered on August 15, 1945. — AFP "

The prime minister agreed that Malaysia should also adopt the United Kingdom’s (UK) principle in providing compensation to fraud victims, provided that banks were found to be negligent. “In a study chaired by the Treasury’s chief secretary, we will also study tightening (the mechanism) making banks liable if found to be not careful in monitoring and ensuring rules were followed,” Anwar said in response to Nurul Amin Hamid’s (PN-Padang Terap) supplementary question. Under new rules in the UK, banks must refund fraud victims up to £85,000 (RM480,600) within five days. Under Malaysian law, banks will return the money to the victim if negligence has been established as stipulated in Section 413 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), he said. Section 413 of the CPC may be used for police officers to seize property linked to an offence and to return it to the person entitled to such property. “As of now, according to Section 413 of the CPC, RM178,407 has been returned,” he said. Losses from online financial crimes in Malaysia had reached RM1.224 billion from January to October this year. The number comprises online scams, telecommunication crimes, love scams, inexistent loans and investments, among others. The “Semak Mule” website has recorded 181,628 phone numbers, 222,092 bank accounts and 1,395 companies linked to online scams. To date, over 32 million searches have been made and about two-thirds of the searches (22,200,984) recorded positive results. “This means there were efforts made to transfer their money into mule accounts but many were saved, because we use the Semak Mule portal,” the prime minister said.

The Yang di-Pertuan Agong expressed sadness over past cases of abuse at UPNM that caused injuries and deaths, saying commanders and officers should take responsibility. “UPNM commanders and officers must be held accountable and resign for failing in their duties. Parents send their children here to become military officers, not to be abused,” he said during his address at his proclamation as UPNM Chancellor and the 14th convocation ceremony at the Kuala Lumpur World Trade Centre today. Excerpts of his speech were shared on the King’s official Facebook page and reposted by the Royal Press Office (RPO). Sultan Ibrahim criticised the university for failing to take serious action despite previous abuse cases being brought to court. “UPNM’s philosophy is to be a leading university in defence, military and security studies. Military discipline and culture are core to this institution,” he said. “To produce military officers, rigorous physical and mental training is necessary, but this must never involve abuse leading to injuries or deaths,” he added. The King, who underwent military training in his youth, described the bullying culture at UPNM as inhumane. He urged the Defence Ministry to prioritise action on a recent bullying case where a cadet trainee suffered fractured ribs and a spinal injury after being stomped on by a senior student. The October 21 incident, involving a 19-year-old cadet and a third-year student, is being investigated under Section 325 of the Penal Code for voluntarily causing grievous hurt. This is the third reported case of bullying-related assaults at UPNM in seven years. Another case involved a senior allegedly pressing a hot iron onto a junior’s chest. The most tragic case was the 2017 death of cadet officer Zulfarhan Osman Zulkarnain, who was tortured and burned with a hot iron. Six UPNM trainees were later convicted of his murder. Sultan Ibrahim urged immediate action to restore UPNM’s reputation and called for an end to its toxic culture. "

Penang High Court Judge Datuk Quay Chew Soon said Chow, as the plaintiff, has successfully proven his case for defamation against the defendant, Tan. He found that Chow’s suit had satisfied all three elements in defamation, in that the impugned statement made by Tan had referred to Chow, that the statements were defamatory and that the statements were published. “It is also my findings that the defences of justification, fair comment and qualified privilege were not proven and I find the defendant had acted with malice and was not entitled to rely on fair comment or qualified privilege,” he said. He said the defamatory statement, that was uttered in Mandarin, lies in three words that translated to mean incompetent, ignorant and shameless. “The plaintiff is the chief minister of Penang and must be perceived as capable and intelligent in the performance of his duties, he must command respect from the people of Penang,” he said when reading out the grounds for his judgement. He said when an influential figure like Tan accused Chow of being incompetent, ignorant and shameless, it has the propensity to smear Chow’s reputation. He also said that whatever the reasons Tan had to call a press conference on October 18 last year, there was no cause for Tan to single out Chow for public humiliation by describing him with those three words. He said the press conference was on the joint development agreement (JDA) of the BKIP2 project but at the time of the press conference, the JDA was already terminated and the BKIP2 project had ceased to exist. “Therefore, public interest was not served when it was on something that does not exist and this statement was not made on a privileged occasion as the public has no legal or moral duty of being informed of a non-existent project,” he said. While he said there was a project and there were a lot of questions circling the project, at the end of the day, the JDA was terminated and the project had ceased to exist. Quay said the Penang Development Corporation (PDC) had embarked on a different approach for the project so it was time to move on and not be saddled with the past. He also found that Tan’s anger towards Chow regarding the Silver Jubilee Home issue had never subsided. “Hence, when the opportunity arose for him to publicly humiliate the plaintiff, in respect of an issue which was unrelated to the Silver Jubilee fund, the defendant seized it,” he said. He said a parallel can be drawn between what Tan said in his resignation letter from the Silver Jubilee trustee board and in his statement in the press conference made four months later. “In essence, both amounted to a scathing attack on the character of Chow in his position as chief minister,” he said. He said the circumstances under which Tan’s resignation letter was written might be different from the press conference but the nature of attack in both instances is the same. “The attack is directed at the competency of the plaintiff as the chief minister, the statement made at the press conference and at paragraph 11 of the resignation letter bears similar connotations, thus when the defendant uttered the impugned statement, it is not wrong to postulate that he was echoing what was said four months earlier in his resignation letter,” he said. In Chow’s suit, he had asked for damages of RM300,000 for each publication of the impugned statements made by Tan which totalled to RM2.1 million. Quay said he is not in favour of making separate awards for each publication so he is awarding global damages of RM350,000 to Chow with interests of five per cent per annum from the date of judgement. “In line of giving a single award, I won’t make a separate award on aggravated damages and exaggerated damages is not warranted as the defendant did not make the statement to enrich himself,” he said. He also awarded Chow RM50,000 in costs. “On apology, I decline to use my discretion to make an order as to forcing a public apology,” he said. He said there was no indication from the defendant of any willingness to apologise and that a willingness to apologise should be sincere and conceived in a contrite heart. “It is counterproductive to force an apology when he’s steadfast in his stance that the wrong he did was supposedly right,” he said. Chow had filed the defamation suit against Tan after the latter made those remarks in a press conference regarding the proposed development project between PDC and Umech Land Sdn Bhd. PDC had announced the termination of the JDA with Umech Land before Tan called the press conference where he called Chow incompetent, ignorant and shameless in Mandarin. Tan’s remarks were published in six Chinese newspapers and one English daily. "

His concerns grew when a two-week family vacation resulted in a bill still running into the hundreds. This prompted him to explore solar power as an alternative. At the time, Chou’s electricity bills for his two-storey terrace house averaged between RM900 and RM1,100 per month. “Having tracked (electricity bills) consistently at RM1,000 or more per month and wondering why the bill was still so high (while away from home) during the vacation, it was time to look into investing in solar power as a long-term investment,” he said when contacted. About a month ago, he installed 27 solar panels and the accompanying system for RM34,000, significantly lowering his expenses. Although Chou is ineligible for rebates under the NEM 3.0 (Net Energy Metering) scheme, which has reached its quota, he still saves on electricity. “We’re not eligible for any kickbacks as the government’s NEM 3.0 (Net Energy Metering) quota is full, but we’re still saving on electricity as the bill is now around RM650-RM700 per month. “Once the quota is open and we get a slot, then we can look into getting returns on our investment,” he said when contacted. “The alternative was to keep spending money (paying electricity bills as usual), knowing it’ll increase in the future, so this was a good financial decision.”   Another homeowner, Muhammad Hazwan Yunus from Keramat, faced similar issues with monthly electricity bills of RM650 to RM700 and rising. He, too, had nine air conditioners at home and his situation was compounded by frequent family gatherings that spiked electricity usage, especially during weekends. Hazwan turned to solar financing and found companies which offers system installation with no upfront costs. Initially sceptical, he researched the concept and found it viable. “You rent the system with a meter installed, and the company charges you accordingly,” he said. “I took this substitution plan from Sols Energy and they installed the system, but now I have two bills. One to Sols, who charge 46 cents per kWh (Kilowatt-hours), and the other to TNB. “Now the TNB bill is around RM60 and the Sols bill is around RM420. I still save,” he toldMalay Mail. According to TNB’s bill calculator, homeowners consuming between 2,000 and 2,300 kWh monthly — leading to bills of RM1,000 to RM1,200 — would see their costs rise to RM1,300 to RM1,500 after adding the 8 per cent service tax. To understand how many kWh you’re using, clickthis link to TNB’s bill calculator. As of January 1, 2024, electricity prices in Malaysia are as follows: According to solar panel installersMalay Mailspoke to, for residential solar systems, the maximum capacity is 17 kWh, which can save households between RM950 and RM1,000 per month. A typical solar panel generates 400 to 500 watts, so a 22-panel system produces about 11 kWh. The cheapest installations cater to homes with RM200 to RM250 monthly bills, while the priciest systems target households with bills exceeding RM1,500. Meanwhile, prices for solar installations have dropped by 20 per cent. A vendor highlighted that the price of a 22-panel solar system has dropped from RM43,000 last year to RM36,000, thanks to improved panel quality and increased imports from China, which have contributed to these cost reductions. Abdul Wahid Ibrahim, an IT manager in Johor, installed a solar system in June to manage bills that exceeded RM1,000, especially during school holidays when his kids were around. He viewed solar power as a strategic investment for long-term financial stability. “The setup includes 23 solar panels, generating 12.65 kWp for a three-phase power supply. I have 23 panels and my TNB bill is RM20-40 now and the entire thing cost around RM23,000.   “I pay RM560 monthly (for the solar panels) through a credit card instalment plan and RM20 to RM40 to TNB. This is about RM600 monthly compared to RM800 to RM1,000 previously,” he said. Abdul Wahid expects to break even in under five years. “At the moment, NEM 3.0 is a ten-year term, but once I’ve cleared this credit card payment, I will pay only RM40 per month,” he said. Abdul Wahid said he preferred to pay for the system outright as he could break even faster than taking a seven- to 10-year plan with a company. “Since I installed mine, I’ve noticed three or four other households in my area doing the same. “Panel prices are generally lower now compared to a year ago, but there might still be some variation. Back then, solar panels was much more expensive,” he said. “If you calculate properly, it’s manageable, and you can break even. Some people think it’s expensive, but with payment schedules — say, using a credit card stretched to 50 months — it becomes much cheaper. “Unfortunately, many vendors only partner with banks for shorter terms, like 12 to 36 months. If they offered financing for 48 to 60 months, it would be much easier for most people,” he added. Malaysian Photovoltaic Industry Association (MPIA) president Davis Chong observed a significant uptick in installations, with major urban centres like the Klang Valley, Johor and Penang leading the charge, with growing interest in states such as Kedah, Melaka, Perak and Negeri Sembilan. Chong said homeowners can expect to see returns on investment within five to eight years, with some achieving payback even sooner. “Over a 25-year period (the typical warranty period for solar panels), homeowners can save significantly on their electricity bills. “For example, a system that costs RM45,000 to install could save an estimated RM90,000 over 25 years,” he toldMalay Mail. Davis also said financing options have expanded, with solar loans and innovative business models making installations more affordable. Programmes like NEM and the SolaRIS rebate offer financial incentives, further encouraging adoption. Technological advancements, including Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS), is also making a difference, allowing homeowners to store excess energy for later use.   Some new housing developments are also pre-installing solar systems, easing adoption for buyers. “On top of that, I think P2P (peer-to-peer) energy trading is a really interesting development. This allows homeowners to sell their extra solar energy to others, creating a new way to earn money from their systems. “It’s a win-win because it makes solar (energy) more financially attractive and could encourage more developers to invest in residential solar (systems),” Chong added. Sols Energy spokesperson and teacher Raj Ridvan Singh said urban and suburban areas, especially in states like Selangor, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang, are experiencing significant growth in solar adoption. He added that government incentives, such as the SolaRIS RM4,000 rebate, have significantly reduced installation costs, making solar more accessible for homeowners. The NEM scheme, introduced by the Malaysian government, reduces reliance on TNB by allowing households to supply excess solar energy back to the grid in exchange for credits. When solar energy is insufficient or during the night when sunlight is unavailable, TNB will supply the energy to meet the household's needs. According to the Sustainable Energy Development Authority (Seda), the current NEMrakyatquota balance is 44.7 MWac, though applications is around ten times that at 405.3 MWac.

2024-12-03,What else can Elon Musk try to claw back the RM250b pay deal he wants from Tesla?,https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2024/12/03/what-else-can-elon-musk-try-to-claw-back-the-rm250b-pay-deal-he-wants-from-tesla/158738,"WILMINGTON, Dec 3 — Tesla cannot give Elon Musk a US$56 billion (RM250 billion) compensation package despite a vote in support of the CEO’s pay deal by the company’s shareholders, a Delaware judge ruled on Monday. Below is a look at what could come next for Tesla and its billionaire founder, who is still seeking a huge payday from the company: What does Musk want? Musk told a special committee of the Tesla board soon after a judge voided his compensation in January that he wanted a similar-sized replacement package, according to a securities filing. In addition, earlier this year he said on his social media platform X that he wanted a larger stake in Tesla or he might develop some products outside the company. Musk’s other companies include rocket venture SpaceX and Neuralink, which develops brain implants. Tesla could appeal the ruling Musk and Tesla’s board could appeal and try to reverse the ruling at the Delaware Supreme Court, a process that typically takes around a year. The case, which involved the largest-ever pay deal at a US public company, raises issues that have rarely been addressed by Delaware judges, adding uncertainty to an appeal. For example, the trial court judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, found that Musk controlled the compensation negotiations, even though he owned only about 22 per cent of Tesla’s stock. In addition, Tesla has acknowledged that the June vote by shareholders to ratify Musk’s pay was a “novel” legal tactic and has said it was unclear how it would be treated under Delaware law. Tesla could devise a new plan Tesla’s board could craft a new pay package, although that could be very expensive. The original plan, agreed to by Musk and the company in 2018, awarded him stock options if the company hit very aggressive performance and financial targets. The stock options allowed Musk to buy Tesla stock priced at the 2018 level. The company exceeded the targets, and Tesla’s stock has risen 10-fold since then, making the options incredibly valuable. Tesla booked a cost of US$2.6 billion when the 2018 plan went into effect. The company has said that a replacement plan for the same cost today would likely have to be less than 10 per cent of the size of the 2018 plan. Could Tesla just restore the old plan? Tesla could offer Musk the same 304 million stock options with the same US$23.34 exercise price used in the 2018 plan. If shareholders wanted to challenge that, they would have to sue in Texas, where the company reincorporated this year, rather than the Court of Chancery in Delaware. But the company cannot escape accounting and tax implications. Tesla said putting the old plan back in place would require the company to take a US$25 billion charge, according to securities filings. In addition, because the stock options would be incredibly valuable from the moment they are issued, they would be treated unfavourably for tax purposes as income. Musk could be taxed at the highest rate and pay a 20 per cent penalty, meaning authorities could tax his new plan at 57 per cent, according to an analysis by Schuyler Moore of Greenberg Glusker Fields Claman & Machtinger. Musk could try to settle the lawsuit Musk could try to settle the lawsuit, which was brought by a Tesla shareholder, and accept a smaller portion of his pay package. However, that would contradict his track record of taking cases to trial rather than striking deals, even in the face of huge potential liability. It is unclear how McCormick would view a settlement at this stage in the litigation. — Reuters"

The 12th prosecution witness, who is also the victim’s friend, said the first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, ninth, 10th, 11th, and 13th accused surrounded the victim and assaulted him while he was lying down. “At the time, I was on the 12th accused’s bed, using my phone. The distance between the bed and the incident was not very far,” he said during the examination-in-chief by Deputy Public Prosecutor Ng Juhn Tao in the murder trial of Mohamad Nazmie Aizzat before Judge Datuk Duncan Sikodol. Thirteen students aged 16 to 19 are jointly charged with murdering 17-year-old Mohamad Nazmie Aizzat in dormitory rooms 7 Resak and 5 Belian at Lahad Datu Vocational College between 9pm on March 21 and 7.38am on March 22. The charge, framed under Section 302 of the Penal Code read with Section 34, provides for the death penalty or imprisonment of 30 to 40 years and up to 12 strokes of the cane, upon conviction. The witness stated that the victim was brought into dormitory room 5 Belian by 10 accused along with the seventh and 12th accused at about 10pm. However, the witness was unsure of the actions of the seventh and 12th accused. The witness said after the incident, the victim left room 5 Belian and returned to dormitory room 7 Resak to bathe but was later brought back to room 5 Belian, where the ninth accused punched his arm before the first accused intervened. “A one-on-one fight occurred between the 11th accused and the victim in the middle of the room before the second accused arrived and inquired about the situation. The first accused explained that the victim had stolen RM50 from the third accused and RM30 from the fourth accused. “The second accused then ordered everyone out except for the 12th accused and another student. He locked the room and turned off the lights,” said the witness, who later heard sounds of something hitting the bed and a metal locker before the first and second accused escorted the victim out of the room. Meanwhile, the 11th prosecution witness testified that he saw the first and fifth accused assaulting the victim in dormitory room 5 Belian at 11pm as he passed by the room on his way to the bathroom. The witness said that he also saw the victim in dormitory room 7 Belian when the second accused was carrying him into the room. The first, fifth, and 11th accused were also present. “At that time, I saw Mohamad Nazmie Aizzat in a weakened state, wrapped in a towel. While lying down, he appeared cold, so I, along with the first, fifth, and 11th accused, covered him with a blanket and dressed him in a shirt belonging to the first accused. “I also noticed bruises on the left side of his ribs and a blue mark on his left ear,” he said, adding that he observed the victim appeared to be sleeping when he woke up for the pre-dawn meal the next morning. The prosecution team comprises Deputy Public Prosecutors Ng Juhn Tao, Nur Nisla Abd Latif, and Batrisyia Mohd Khusri. Eight of the 13 teenagers are represented by lawyers Datuk Ram Singh, Kamarudin Mohmad Chinki, and Chen Wen Jye, while the other five are represented by Mohamad Zairi Zainal Abidin, Abdul Ghani Zelika, Vivian Thien, Jhesseny P Kang, and Kusni Ambotuwo.

2024-12-03,Beat the rainy season blues with fresh Teochew seafood porridge and bouncy fish balls at Ang Mo Kang in Cheras,https://www.malaymail.com/news/eat-drink/2024/12/03/beat-the-rainy-season-blues-with-fresh-teochew-seafood-porridge-and-bouncy-fish-balls-at-ang-mo-kang-in-cheras/158726,"KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 3 – With the year end downpour, we have been feeling a tad chilly. Nothing better, really, than something soupy to warm us up and beat the rainy season blues. Something soupy or perhaps porridge? This is the star attraction at Ang Mo Kang Sekinchan Restaurant in Taman Bukit Segar, Cheras. Their Teochew style fish or seafood porridge, made with whatever is freshly caught and delivered directly from Sekinchan – hence the name. When asked, the manager shared with us that Ang Mo Kang is another name for Sekinchan, a small town in north-west Selangor. Famed for its paddy fields, Sekinchan is also a major fishing village so it is also known for its fresh seafood.   Indeed there are many seafood restaurants in Sekinchan, a whole row of them facing the fishing jetties. Most of the villagers and fishermen are Teochew so this cuisine is predominantly identified with how locals prepare their seafood. The draw at Ang Mo Kang, then, is for KL-ites to enjoy fresh Sekinchan seafood and Teochew style home cooking without making the two-hour, 100-kilometre drive to the fishing village itself. Regulars can choose from a variety of fish for their Teochew Fish Porridge, from the more popular grouper and pomfret to threadfin and red snapper. Clams are also available for those who prefer a more mollusc-forward porridge.   If you can’t make up your mind, a conundrum we often face, then do as we usually do in such circumstances and go for a mix. We went for a Teochew Mixed Seafood Porridge that included prawns and squid. For the mixed option, you can choose either grouper or pomfret for your fish component. While each bowl is cooked to order, the wait isn’t long to ensure the seafood isn’t overcooked. Our morsels of grouper were utterly tender without being mushy, a sign that fresh rather than frozen seafood is used. There isn’t the usual fishy smell, another sign of freshness. The prawns certainly stood out here, each still retaining a beautiful snap when we bite into the juicy sweet flesh. The broth was light but flavourful, enriched by the assortment of seafood with only a few strands of julienned young ginger needed to balance it. What a bowlful of comforting goodness!   If the seafood porridge served to nourish us, then the other dishes we chose were purely for pleasure. We had asked the manager for his recommendations and he suggested the Fried Chilli Shrimp and Fish Ball Soup. To be quite honest, the Fried Chilli Shrimp didn’t look like much when the server placed the dish on our table. Perhaps the dimensions were unhelpful; a large platter and a scattering of stir fried shrimps on a couple pale leaves of lettuce. Looks can be deceiving. Though the shrimps appeared diminutive in size (they have been stir fried after all) and far from fiery red in colour, they really packed a punch in terms of flavour and heat. These are addictive, so good we mostly ate them on their own without needing the accompaniment of a spoonful of porridge.   As tempted as we were to order another round of the spicy Fried Chilli Shrimp, we were glad we didn’t because our order of Fish Ball Soup was quite filling. These are available as bowls of five or 10 handmade fish balls. We went for the second option, so five bouncy fish balls each. Every bite had that desired “QQ” chew. More fish than filler, so we ate without guilt. Other recommended dishes include the Fried Clam Beehoon, Ginger Duck Porridge and Fried Fish Cake, but we really didn’t have space for more. Maybe next time. The space itself was clean and minimalist. Simply furnished. Besides the tables and chairs, there was nothing more in terms of décor beyond a row of posters showcasing the signature dishes.   Then again, when the food is this fresh and well prepared, you don’t really need fancy baubles and trimmings to draw customers into your shop. Word of mouth and consistent quality will keep regulars returning again and again. We certainly will come back.

2024-12-03,Do not pass go: Elon Musk loses bid to restore US$56b Tesla pay package,https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2024/12/03/do-not-pass-go-elon-musk-loses-bid-to-restore-us56b-tesla-pay-package/158719,"WILMINGTON (Delaware), Dec 3 — A Delaware judge ruled yesterday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a US$56 billion (RM250 billion) compensation package despite shareholders of the electric vehicle company voting to reinstate it. The ruling by the judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, follows her January decision that called the pay package excessive and rescinded it, surprising investors, and cast uncertainty over Musk’s future at the world’s most valuable carmaker. Musk did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company’s driving force who is responsible for many of its advances and reinstate his compensation. McCormick said Tesla’s board was not entitled to hit “reset” to restore Musk’s pay package. “Were the court to condone the practice of allowing defeated parties to create new facts for the purpose of revising judgments, lawsuits would become interminable,” she said in her 101-page opinion. She also said Tesla made multiple material misstatements in its proxy statement regarding the vote and could not claim the vote was a “cure-all” to justify restoring Musk’s pay. “Taken together,” the problems with Tesla’s arguments “pack a powerful punch,” she wrote. Tesla shares fell 1.4 per cent in after-hours trade, after the ruling. McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the case US$345 million, well short of the US$6 billion they initially requested. She said the fee could be paid in cash or Tesla stock. “We are pleased with Chancellor McCormick’s ruling, which declined Tesla’s invitation to inject continued uncertainty into Court proceedings,” said a statement from Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, one of the three law firms for the plaintiff. The law firm also said it looked forward to defending the court’s opinion if Musk and Tesla appealed. Musk and Tesla can appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court as soon as McCormick enters a final order, which could come as soon as this week. The appeal could take a year to play out. After the January ruling, Tesla shareholders flooded the court with thousands of letters arguing that rescinding Musk’s pay increased the possibility he would leave Tesla or develop some products like artificial intelligence at ventures other than Tesla. Attorneys for shareholder Richard Tornetta, who sued in 2018 to challenge Musk’s compensation package, had argued that Delaware law does not permit a company to use a ratification vote to essentially overturn the ruling from a trial. McCormick in January found that Musk improperly controlled the 2018 board process to negotiate the pay package. The board had said that Musk deserved the package because he hit all the ambitious targets on market value, revenue and profitability. But the judge criticized Tesla’s board as “beholden” to Musk, saying the compensation plan was proposed by a board whose members had conflicts of interest due to close personal and financial ties to him. After the January ruling, Musk criticised the judge on his social media platform X and encouraged other companies to follow the lead of Tesla and reincorporate in Texas from Delaware, although it is unclear if any companies did so. The judge in her January ruling called the pay package the “biggest compensation plan ever - an unfathomable sum.” It was 33 times larger than the next biggest executive compensation package, which was Musk’s 2012 pay plan. As of yesterday, the pay package was worth US$101.4 billion, according to Equilar, a compensation consulting firm. Musk’s 2018 pay package gave him stock grants worth around 1 per cent of Tesla’s equity each time the company achieved one of 12 tranches of escalating operational and financial goals. Musk did not receive any guaranteed salary. Tornetta argued that shareholders were not told how easily the goals would be achieved when they voted on the package. — Reuters  "

The threat comes after exhaustive diplomacy by outgoing President Joe Biden’s administration that has so far failed to secure a deal that would both end Israel’s war in Gaza and free hostages seized 14 months ago. “If the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!” Trump has vowed staunch support for Israel and to dispense with Biden’s occasional criticism, but has also spoken of his desire to secure deals on the world stage. Hamas staged the deadliest ever attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. The assault resulted in 1,208 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Militants seized 251 hostages during the attack, some of whom were already dead. Of those, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 35 the army says are dead.

2024-12-03,BBC urged to pull ‘MasterChef’ off-air amid sexual harassment claims against presenter Gregg Wallace,https://www.malaymail.com/news/showbiz/2024/12/03/bbc-urged-to-pull-masterchef-off-air-amid-sexual-harassment-claims-against-presenter-gregg-wallace/158721,"LONDON, Dec 3 — The BBC faced pressure yesterday to take one of its most popular and long-running shows, “MasterChef”, off air following claims one of the programme’s presenters engaged in sexually harassing behaviour. Presenter Gregg Wallace has denied making “inappropriate” sexual jokes and comments after more than a dozen people came forward last week with allegations spanning a 17-year period. But he was forced into making a new apology on yesterday for his remarks. The furore is the latest scandal to hit the taxpayer-funded British broadcaster. Another prime-time show, “Strictly Come Dancing”, was thrown into crisis this year amid bullying accusations. And former top news anchor, Huw Edwards, pleaded guilty in July to making indecent pictures of children, narrowly avoiding jail in a stunning fall from grace. The production company behind “MasterChef”, a decades-old show aired on the BBC whose branded format is now produced in more than 50 countries, has said it is probing the claims against Wallace. It also announced that Wallace would stop presenting while it investigates, but that the current recorded season of “MasterChef: The Professionals” would continue to air. The allegations against Wallace emerged from a BBC News investigation which also reported the broadcaster had warned the presenter after a complaint was made in 2018. Wallace sparked a further backlash over the new claims when he said in a video posted Sunday that they had been made by “a handful of middle-class women of a certain age”. Wallace apologised yesterday for “any offence that I caused” with those comments. One of his accusers had said they showed he “clearly hasn’t learnt his lesson”. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s spokesman told reporters Wallace’s comments were a “completely inappropriate and misogynistic” response to the “deeply concerning” claims. The spokesman noted Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy held talks with BBC bosses last week “to seek assurances that there are robust processes in place to deal with complaints”. The broadcaster is conducting an independent review into workplace culture which Starmer’s spokesman said “must deliver clear and timely recommendations”. Earlier yesterday Labour MP Rupa Huq, a member of parliament’s watchdog Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said the BBC should consider not airing the current season as well as upcoming Christmas episodes. “I think possibly there is an argument for pausing while this investigation takes its course,” Huq told BBC radio, adding the broadcaster “should send a strong signal [about] this sort of behaviour”.

2024-12-03,Intel CEO Gelsinger leaves amid turnaround troubles,https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2024/12/03/intel-ceo-gelsinger-leaves-amid-turnaround-troubles/158720,"NEW YORK, Dec 3 — Intel announced yesterday that CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired effective December 1, as the once dominant chip-making giant company struggles to catch up with rivals. The abrupt departure comes after the company in August vowed to cut more than 15,000 jobs in a draconian cost-reduction plan and paused or delayed construction on several chipmaking facilities. The company named CFO David Zinsner and newly appointed Intel Products CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim co-chief executives while it searches for a permanent successor. Gelsinger, who began his career at Intel in 1979 and served as its first chief technology officer, returned to the company as CEO in 2021 during a critical period for the company. Intel is one of Silicon Valley’s most iconic companies, but its fortunes have been eclipsed by Asian powerhouses TSMC and Samsung which dominate the made-to-order semiconductor business. The company was also caught by surprise with the emergence of Nvidia, a graphics chip maker, as the world’s preeminent AI chip maker. Under Gelsinger’s leadership, Intel invested heavily in semiconductor manufacturing and worked to revitalize its production capabilities, often by relying heavily on government subsidies. US President Joe Biden’s administration last month finalised a US$$7.9 billion (RM35.3 billion) award to Intel as part of his effort of bringing semiconductor production to US shores. But in Europe, Intel last month said it was delaying its plans to build two mega chip-making factories in Germany and Poland as the company faces lower demand than anticipated. Intel also said it would pull back on its projects in Malaysia. “Leading Intel has been the honour of my lifetime,” Gelsinger said in a statement, acknowledging the “challenging year” as the company adapted to market conditions. Zinsner joined Intel in 2022 from Micron Technology, while Holthaus is a nearly 30-year Intel veteran who previously led the company’s Client Computing Group. “We know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Board chairman Frank Yeary said in the company’s statement. In September, the Wall Street Journal reported that rival Qualcomm had made a takeover approach of embattled Intel, which has a market cap of just over US$100 billion. Intel’s share price yesterday, which has slumped by 50 per cent this year, was up by nearly three per cent on Wall Street. — AFP  "

Deputy Human Resource Minister Datuk Seri Abdul Rahman Mohamad, when winding up the debate on the bill in the Dewan Negara yesterday, said the extension aligns with the International Labour Organisation’s Convention, which recommended a minimum of 14 weeks of maternity leave. “The amendment also introduced a seven-day paternity leave provision (unrecorded leave) for married male employees, capped at five childbirths, thus ensuring private sector male employees enjoy benefits similar to those provided to civil servants. “The ministry views this facility as essential to enable husbands to support their wives during childbirth, stabilise their emotional well-being, care for the newborn and handle other matters such as birth registration,” he said. During the debate, Senator Datuk Judiet Fidilis @ Noraini Idris sought clarification on whether the extended maternity leave provision applies to all female employees in Sabah. The Senate then passed the bill with a majority voice vote after being debated by four senators. Also passed was the Prevention and Control of Infectious Disease (Amendment) Bill 2024, aimed at bolstering the country’s preparedness against future infectious disease threats. Deputy Health Minister Datuk Lukanisman Awang Sauni said the amendments include a clause empowering health officers to use “force” to ensure compliance with their directives. “The ‘force’ strictly refers to verbal instructions or orders. It does not involve physical actions such as hitting, coercing or detaining individuals and remains consistent with fundamental rights enshrined in the Federal Constitution. “Authorised officers are trained personnel who must act within enforcement guidelines to prevent power abuse. Therefore, I urge officers to adhere to these guidelines and not exceed their authority,” he said while winding up the debate on the bill. The bill, which also empowers officers to order individuals infected with an infectious disease to undergo isolation or surveillance, was passed after debates by 15 senators, including Senator Dr Lingeshwaran R. Arunasalam. The Dewan Negara sitting will resume today. — Bernama"

Investigators discovered the powdered substance, believed to be synthetic drugs, inside the medicine packets after arresting a couple in a park in Seri Alam on November 28. Seri Alam police chief Supt Mohd Sohaimi Ishak said the arrest led Narcotics Criminal Investigation Division (NCID) operatives to raid a nearby two-storey terrace house on the same day. The six-hour raid, which began at 10pm, exposed the syndicate’s ruse for distributing the drugs to the public. “The rented house was also used as a drug storage conduit before repacking and distributing to customers,” he told reporters at the Seri Alam district police headquarters today. During the raid, police seized 474 grammes of ketamine, 295 grammes of ecstasy pills, 397 grammes of ecstasy powder, and 215 grammes of Eramin 5 psychotropic pills, believed to have been sourced in Johor Baru. Officers also seized a grey Perodua Myvi worth RM12,000 from the premises. “The total value of the seizure is RM63,050, and investigators believe the drugs could supply upwards of 5,300 addicts,” Mohd Sohaimi said. The arrested suspects, a couple aged 43 and 27, are in police custody and have been remanded until tomorrow for further investigation. Both suspects, who are locals, tested positive for methamphetamine abuse during routine drug screening and have no prior criminal records. “Police have initiated investigations under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 for trafficking in dangerous drugs,” he said, adding that efforts are underway to track the syndicate’s mastermind and other members still at large. This case marks the first reported instance of narcotics being repackaged into diarrhoea medicine to evade detection. Previously, police uncovered syndicates repackaging illicit drugs in Chinese herbal tea or three-in-one beverage packets. These repackaged drugs, often ketamine or amphetamine-based, are typically found during raids on KTV karaoke outlets and nightclubs in major cities nationwide. "

State Housing and Local Government Committee chairman Sandrea Ng Shy Ching said developers should conduct more in-depth market studies to identify the type of housing needed and ensure the prices offered are reasonable to address the issue of unsold properties. “Developers should bear a significant responsibility to ensure that each development project aligns with the needs and capabilities of the local community. “It is crucial to be sensitive to these factors to ensure a balance between housing demand and supply and to avoid unsold properties in the future,” she said. However, Ng added that the latest NAPIC report showed a significant decrease in unsold housing units, from 4,161 units to 3,039 units in the third quarter of 2024. Ng was responding to a question from Selinsing assemblyman Sallehuddin Abdullah, who asked about unsold housing properties and abandoned housing projects in Perak. Ng said the state government, through the Perak Housing and Property Board (LPHP), has taken immediate measures to address the issue. “This includes holding discussions with relevant parties such as NAPIC, the Real Estate and Housing Developers’ Association Malaysia (REHDA), and local authorities to identify the locations of housing projects. “Factors contributing to the overhang problem, such as construction location, marketing strategies, the large number of units launched, development concepts, and selling prices, were also identified during the discussions,” she explained. Ng also noted that there is currently no detailed mechanism to collect data on the number of housing projects sold by districts and house types. “However, the state government, through LPHP, is actively developing a housing dashboard that will enable more systematic and effective monitoring and analysis of data in the future,” she said. Meanwhile, Ng said a total of six housing projects have been declared abandoned by the Ministry of Housing and Local Government. “There are two projects in the Kinta district, two in Manjung, one in Kampar, and one in Batang Padang,” she said.

Khaw toldMalay Mailthat the airline had acted swiftly to address the issue with Zacharevic, though he refrained from disclosing specifics about the ongoing matter. “We are working on that. We have reached out to Ernest, he has been in touch as well,” Khaw said in a short reply, when met at the AirAsia headquarters, here. Zacharevic, who gained fame for his street murals in Penang, expressed his determination to take further action if the airline continued to use his work without consent. The artist, who shot to fame after his series of murals in Penang became well-known, said it was not the first time this had happened. “I am hoping to resolve this quickly with AirAsia, but should such effort proves futile, I am willing to go as far as it takes to put a stop to this for good,” he toldMalay Mailin an email interview. Last week, Zacharevic posted a picture of an AirAsia airplane at the Penang International Airport that had a copy of his Children On Bicycle mural, decorating the forward part of the fuselage behind the cockpit. He had tagged the airline and its founder Tan Sri Tony Fernandes in the post with one line: “I think we need to talk...”. “This is not the first time it happens, and it’s time that a corporate giant like AirAsia demonstrates corporate responsibilities and respect for rights of artists and intellectual property,” he added. He added that his team is also reaching out to AirAsia regarding the issue, but it was “difficult to get through the many corporate layers to the correct person.” He said he is not sure how many of AirAsia’s planes featured his artwork without his consent, but he saw the first one at the Penang International Airport on November 22. “I am guessing there are a few of them,” he said.

Markol Consulting Group, who is representing Min alongside Sejong Law Firm, confirmed the lawsuit was lodged with the Yongsan Police Station yesterday. “We have filed a lawsuit for the violations of the Act on Promotion of Information and Communication Network Utilisation and Information Protection with the Yongsan Police Station,” it said in a statement. The statement named former HYBE chief executive officer Park Ji-won, HYBE chief operating officer Park Tae-hee and reporters Kim Ji-ho and Park Hye-jin from the tabloidDispatch. According to the statement, the allegations stem from events in April, when the two HYBE executives allegedly accessed and leaked private conversations about Min. Markol Consulting Group claimed the executives worked with theDispatchreporters to publish articles aimed at discrediting Min based on the executives’ claims. Markol Consulting also pointed to a recent article by the reporters, published on December 2, as evidence of ongoing defamation. The statement described the article as “far from the truth,” claiming it included “one-sided assumptions and guesses.” The article had claimed, among others, that Min had allegedly used sexual favours to climb up the ranks, and “employed love spells by shamans” to achieve this. HYBE, known for managing top K-pop acts such as BTS, has not issued a statement regarding the allegations. Recently, chart-topping girl group NewJeans said they are quitting the label ADOR after its parent HYBE tried to push Min out.

2024-12-03,Beat the rainy season blues with fresh Teochew seafood porridge and bouncy fish balls at Ang Mo Kang in Cheras,https://www.malaymail.com/news/eat-drink/2024/12/03/beat-the-rainy-season-blues-with-fresh-teochew-seafood-porridge-and-bouncy-fish-balls-at-ang-mo-kang-in-cheras/158726,"KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 3 – With the year end downpour, we have been feeling a tad chilly. Nothing better, really, than something soupy to warm us up and beat the rainy season blues. Something soupy or perhaps porridge? This is the star attraction at Ang Mo Kang Sekinchan Restaurant in Taman Bukit Segar, Cheras. Their Teochew style fish or seafood porridge, made with whatever is freshly caught and delivered directly from Sekinchan – hence the name. When asked, the manager shared with us that Ang Mo Kang is another name for Sekinchan, a small town in north-west Selangor. Famed for its paddy fields, Sekinchan is also a major fishing village so it is also known for its fresh seafood.   Indeed there are many seafood restaurants in Sekinchan, a whole row of them facing the fishing jetties. Most of the villagers and fishermen are Teochew so this cuisine is predominantly identified with how locals prepare their seafood. The draw at Ang Mo Kang, then, is for KL-ites to enjoy fresh Sekinchan seafood and Teochew style home cooking without making the two-hour, 100-kilometre drive to the fishing village itself. Regulars can choose from a variety of fish for their Teochew Fish Porridge, from the more popular grouper and pomfret to threadfin and red snapper. Clams are also available for those who prefer a more mollusc-forward porridge.   If you can’t make up your mind, a conundrum we often face, then do as we usually do in such circumstances and go for a mix. We went for a Teochew Mixed Seafood Porridge that included prawns and squid. For the mixed option, you can choose either grouper or pomfret for your fish component. While each bowl is cooked to order, the wait isn’t long to ensure the seafood isn’t overcooked. Our morsels of grouper were utterly tender without being mushy, a sign that fresh rather than frozen seafood is used. There isn’t the usual fishy smell, another sign of freshness. The prawns certainly stood out here, each still retaining a beautiful snap when we bite into the juicy sweet flesh. The broth was light but flavourful, enriched by the assortment of seafood with only a few strands of julienned young ginger needed to balance it. What a bowlful of comforting goodness!   If the seafood porridge served to nourish us, then the other dishes we chose were purely for pleasure. We had asked the manager for his recommendations and he suggested the Fried Chilli Shrimp and Fish Ball Soup. To be quite honest, the Fried Chilli Shrimp didn’t look like much when the server placed the dish on our table. Perhaps the dimensions were unhelpful; a large platter and a scattering of stir fried shrimps on a couple pale leaves of lettuce. Looks can be deceiving. Though the shrimps appeared diminutive in size (they have been stir fried after all) and far from fiery red in colour, they really packed a punch in terms of flavour and heat. These are addictive, so good we mostly ate them on their own without needing the accompaniment of a spoonful of porridge.   As tempted as we were to order another round of the spicy Fried Chilli Shrimp, we were glad we didn’t because our order of Fish Ball Soup was quite filling. These are available as bowls of five or 10 handmade fish balls. We went for the second option, so five bouncy fish balls each. Every bite had that desired “QQ” chew. More fish than filler, so we ate without guilt. Other recommended dishes include the Fried Clam Beehoon, Ginger Duck Porridge and Fried Fish Cake, but we really didn’t have space for more. Maybe next time. The space itself was clean and minimalist. Simply furnished. Besides the tables and chairs, there was nothing more in terms of décor beyond a row of posters showcasing the signature dishes.   Then again, when the food is this fresh and well prepared, you don’t really need fancy baubles and trimmings to draw customers into your shop. Word of mouth and consistent quality will keep regulars returning again and again. We certainly will come back.

While creative differences, the strain of stardom and John Lennon’s girlfriend Yoko Ono have all been blamed for the Fab Four’s break-up, the documents reveal the numerous convoluted legal battles that also weighed on the band. The documents, which were discovered in a cupboard where they had been stored since the 1970s, include copies of The Beatles advisor’s minutes of meetings, legal writs and a copy of the band’s 1967 Original Deed of Partnership. They show that after manager Brian Epstein died in 1967, the band realised that money was unaccounted for and that they were being pursued by tax authorities. Another damaging legal battle erupted when Paul McCartney opposed the decision by other band members to hire Allen Klein as their new manager. The uncovered stash of files document the subsequent 1970 High Court battle launched by McCartney against the band in London, which exposed Klein’s mismanagement. “It would be almost impossible to exaggerate the actual complexity of the various legal arrangements which have been entered into by Messrs. Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, and Starkey (Ringo Starr),” said notes on one document. Other legal difficulties besetting the band included deciding when Pete Best left the group and Ringo Starr joined, royalties for film and music rights and Klein’s inability to produce accounts for the tax authorities. “Even though John, Paul, George, and Ringo had grown tired of being The Beatles and wanted to record and perform as individual artists, this must have been a difficult time for each of them,” said Denise Kelly, head of Dawsons Entertainment and Popular Culture department. “I could sense panic in the room as more and more complexities came to light. One of the lawyers even suggested during one meeting when they had gone round and round and round in circles: ‘would it be easier if The Beatles just retired’?” McCartney said in 1970 that he was no longer working with the group, but the legal process of breaking up the band was only finalised in 1974. A 1971 letter written by Lennon to fellow UK music titan Eric Clapton, to be auctioned on Thursday, showed his desire to plot a new course after The Beatles, inviting him to join a “nucleus group” with super-producer Phil Spector. The documents will be offered in Dawsons upcoming Entertainment & Memorabilia auction on December 12, and are expected to sell for more than £5,000 (RM28,200). — AFP "

Presenter Gregg Wallace has denied making “inappropriate” sexual jokes and comments after more than a dozen people came forward last week with allegations spanning a 17-year period. But he was forced into making a new apology on yesterday for his remarks. The furore is the latest scandal to hit the taxpayer-funded British broadcaster. Another prime-time show, “Strictly Come Dancing”, was thrown into crisis this year amid bullying accusations. And former top news anchor, Huw Edwards, pleaded guilty in July to making indecent pictures of children, narrowly avoiding jail in a stunning fall from grace. The production company behind “MasterChef”, a decades-old show aired on the BBC whose branded format is now produced in more than 50 countries, has said it is probing the claims against Wallace. It also announced that Wallace would stop presenting while it investigates, but that the current recorded season of “MasterChef: The Professionals” would continue to air. The allegations against Wallace emerged from a BBC News investigation which also reported the broadcaster had warned the presenter after a complaint was made in 2018. Wallace sparked a further backlash over the new claims when he said in a video posted Sunday that they had been made by “a handful of middle-class women of a certain age”. Wallace apologised yesterday for “any offence that I caused” with those comments. One of his accusers had said they showed he “clearly hasn’t learnt his lesson”. Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s spokesman told reporters Wallace’s comments were a “completely inappropriate and misogynistic” response to the “deeply concerning” claims. The spokesman noted Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy held talks with BBC bosses last week “to seek assurances that there are robust processes in place to deal with complaints”. The broadcaster is conducting an independent review into workplace culture which Starmer’s spokesman said “must deliver clear and timely recommendations”. Earlier yesterday Labour MP Rupa Huq, a member of parliament’s watchdog Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said the BBC should consider not airing the current season as well as upcoming Christmas episodes. “I think possibly there is an argument for pausing while this investigation takes its course,” Huq told BBC radio, adding the broadcaster “should send a strong signal [about] this sort of behaviour”. Wallace’s lawyers have said “it is entirely false that he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature”. A BBC spokesperson said it had “robust processes” to deal with complaints “swiftly and appropriately” and added it “will always listen if people want to make us aware of something directly”. — AFP"

The K-pop star shared how songwriting helped her heal from hurtful social media comments. “I wanted to avoid them (negative comments), but like anyone else ... I was affected. However, I learned that those feelings could become a source of inspiration for music. “Once I accepted those emotions and started writing, I began to feel better, heal, and forgive myself,” she said, referencing her track “number one girl.” Rosé has been candid about her struggles. A week prior, she toldThe New York Timesabout the toll of online bullying, even admitting it brought her to tears. Now riding high on the success of her latest single “APT.” — which has stormed into Billboard’s Top 10 — Rosé is gearing up for the release of her first solo albumrosie, dropping this Friday. The 12-track album includes both “APT.” and “number one girl,” showcasing a deeply personal side of the artist. Reflecting on “APT.” she shared a lighthearted memory: “I was abroad working on my music album. One late night, my friends and I ordered hamburgers. While eating, I taught them a drinking game — it’s my favourite game — and they loved it. Watching my non-Korean friends go crazy over it inspired me to write a song the very next day.” The overwhelmingly positive reception to the track has left her stunned. “It was beyond my expectations,” she told JTBC. Explaining the significance of her album’s title, she added, “Rosie is my English name. “The songs on this album are deeply personal — they’re simple, without heavy effects, but their lyrics resonate with me. I hope these songs will touch others the same way they’ve touched me,” she added."

The energetic performance and melodious voices of the group’s four young members garnered cheers from around 1,600 people who turned up to watch them, dressed in dark red and black to match the event’s theme. Opening the show with their hit song “Flowerwork”, the appearance of Lee Sung-hyub, Yoo Hwe-sung, Cha Hun and Seo Dong-sung on stage immediately set the crowd “alight” as fans turned on their lightsticks and sang along with their favourite artistes. The singers even attempted to speak in Bahasa Melayu. Their “Malaysia! Apa khabar sayang? Mantap!(Malaysia! How are you, dear? Great!)” earned loud cheers from fans. The group also performed two songs, “Awesome” (released in 2016) and “The Real” (2020), twice during the concert after fans requested encores. The band members promised their Malaysian fans they would return for another performance once their drummer Kim Jae-hyun completes his military service. Even after performing over 20 songs, fans were still chanting “Encore!” indicating they could not get enough of the South Korean group’s captivating presence. Some of the songs performed during the concert were “Video Therapy”, “Born to Be”, “Star”, “Blue Moon”, “Rooftop”, “RUN RUN” and “Stand by Me”. — Bernama"

Well, Jon Collins-Black is making that dream a reality — but with a twist. His new book,There’s Treasure Inside, isn’t just a fun read; it’s a treasure map that’s sending adventurers across the United States on a thrilling quest to find five hidden chests, each containing riches worth over US$2 million (RM9 million). Collins-Black, a lifelong fantasy fan who grew up immersed in games likeDungeons & Dragons, told CNN that he has always been fascinated by the idea of treasure hunts. By 2015, after a successful career as a musician and entrepreneur, he was ready for a new challenge. Inspired by Forrest Fenn’s famous 2010 treasure hunt, Collins-Black set out to create something that would ignite the imagination of treasure seekers nationwide. “I wanted to have the chests spread out to give people the optimistic, adventurous possibility,” Collins-Black explained to CNN. Instead of a single hidden chest tucked away in the mountains, he envisioned multiple chests spread across the country, offering everyone a chance to get close to the treasure. Each chapter ofThere’s Treasure Insideholds detailed clues leading to one of the chests, and while Collins-Black isn’t spilling the beans on specifics, he assures readers that all the clues needed to find the treasure are in the book itself. To keep things under wraps, Collins-Black worked with as few people as possible. Even his wife didn’t get the scoop. “I couldn’t really consult other people because I didn’t want them to have the burden,” he was quoted as saying by CNN. It was a massive undertaking, and Collins-Black admits he had to experiment with the difficulty level of the clues through trial and error, but the result is a hunt that promises to challenge even the most dedicated treasure hunters. As excitement builds, thousands of treasure seekers are already gathering online, discussing theories and speculating on where the treasure might be hidden. Some are even convinced they’ve pinpointed the states where the chests are located. But don’t worry — this hunt is designed to be safe for all adventurers. No dangerous diving, climbing, or trespassing required. The sites are accessible to those in average health, and no digging is necessary. For Collins-Black, it’s all about fun — but don’t expect a treasure hunt that lasts for decades. “I do hope and think it might take a little while, but I don’t need this to take forever,” he told CNN. If the chests remain unfound, he may release more clues, or even write a sequel to keep the adventure alive. So what exactly is hidden inside these chests? Collins-Black carefully curated the treasures, working with historians and attending auctions to gather a one-of-a-kind collection. He even financed the pieces with money he saved from early bitcoin investments. Inside the chests, treasure hunters will find everything from rare Pokémon cards and shipwreck bounty to sports memorabilia, gold, and precious medals. There are even items with deep historical significance, like artefacts from Pablo Picasso, George Washington, Amelia Earhart, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. While it’s tough for Collins-Black to pick a favourite, a few items stand out: a brooch once owned by Jackie Kennedy Onassis, a 96-carat emerald, and Wilma Rudolph’s 1960 Olympic gold medal. One item that didn’t make the cut, though, was an Albert Einstein pipe — Collins-Black lost it in a bidding war. To make things even more exciting, one chest has been made larger and more valuable than the others, raising the stakes for anyone brave enough to hunt it down. So will you be the one to find the grand prize? Time to start the hunt!"
2024-12-03,Tokyo brewer sees Unesco recognition as the game-changer struggling sake needs to go global like sushi,https://www.malaymail.com/news/life/2024/12/02/tokyo-brewer-sees-unesco-recognition-as-the-game-changer-struggling-sake-needs-to-go-global-like-sushi/158637,"FUSSA (Japan), Dec 2 — At a Tokyo brewery dating back to the days of the samurai, Koichi Maesako drops a three-metre-long wooden paddle into a giant, jade-coloured tank and gently stirs the white mixture that will turn into sake in a week’s time. The sweet-and-sour-smelling brew — of rice, yeast starter, the culinary mould known askojiand water — has been fermenting for 20 days in what is part of an ancient technique that Unesco is set to list as Intangible Cultural Heritage this week. For Maesako, the 40-year-old chief brewer of Ishikawa Shuzou, or Ishikawa Brewery, the UN agency’s endorsement would be welcome news after a difficult couple of years. Unseasonably warm weather has hit the rice harvest, not only affecting the quality of the grain but also raising procurement costs, he said.   Traditional sake brewers had already been contending with decades of falling sales at home as consumers acquired a taste for cocktails like highballs and other alcoholic drinks. “The situation is much tougher compared to previous years,” Maesako told Reuters last week. “It’s still quite warm, even though it’s almost December. The price of rice is high and the harvest is poor, which has made sake-brewing (this year) very challenging.”   Maesako hopes the UN body’s recognition of the traditional brewing technique will turn things around by igniting demand overseas, where sake has slowly gained popularity alongside Japanese cuisine, also in part thanks to Unesco’s endorsement ofwashokuas living heritage in 2013. “After being listed by Unesco, Japanese traditional cuisine (washoku) has spread all over the world,” Maesako said. “I hope that the same thing will happen with sake. Our brewery is seeing a rise in exports, and we hope the Unesco listing will accelerate this trend.”   The centuries-old method of making sake is unique for its three-step preparation, or “San-Dan-Jikomi”, of allowing multiple fermentation processes to progress simultaneously in a single container. “It’s really cool just seeing and understanding how it all comes together,” said Robert Brown, an American visitor at the brewery. “Taking a lot of Japan’s history and then turning it into a cultural heritage seems really cool to me.”   While sake has lost ground as a regular drink, Maesako said it remains impossible to separate from Japanese culture. “We have sake at celebrations, at New Year’s, and also on sad occasions, like funerals,” he said. “The culture of Japanese sake is the culture of Japan itself.” The brewing technique is expected to be formally endorsed at a Unesco committee session in Paraguay this week. It will be Japan’s 23rd entry on the list of Intangible Cultural Heritage. — Reuters"

2024-12-03,Here’s what to know ahead of Notre-Dame’s reopening on December 7,https://www.malaymail.com/news/life/2024/12/01/heres-what-to-know-ahead-of-notre-dames-reopening-on-december-7/158487,"PARIS, Dec 1 — Paris’ Notre-Dame Cathedral will reopen on December 7, five and a half years after a devastating fire destroyed its roof and spire and caused major damage throughout. Here is what you need to know: What is Notre-Dame? A medieval Gothic masterpiece, Notre-Dame de Paris (Our Lady of Paris) is one of the French capital’s most beloved and visited monuments. Its rib vaulting, flying buttresses, stunning stained-glass windows and carved stone gargoyles have long been celebrated in books and movies. The first stone was laid in 1163, and construction continued for much of the next century, with major restoration and additions made in the 17th and 18th century. Victor Hugo used the cathedral as a setting for his 1831 novel,The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. Quasimodo, the main character, has been portrayed by Hollywood actors including Charles Laughton and also in an animated Disney adaptation. Why and how did it burn? On the evening of April 15, 2019, the cathedral’s roof burst into flames. Soon, the fire had engulfed the spire and almost toppled the main bell towers. Around the world, TV viewers watched with horror as the medieval building burned. The roof collapsed but the bell towers and facade held. It remains unclear what exactly caused the fire. French authorities have said an electrical fault or a burning cigarette may have been responsible. What will happen at the opening ceremony? President Emmanuel Macron will give a speech in front of the cathedral on Saturday, December 7, around 6.00pm (1.00am Malaysian time) after which Paris’ Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will use his crosier to knock on the cathedral’s heavy doors. From within the cathedral, a psalm will be sung three times in response to the knocking, after which the doors will open. The archbishop will bless the cathedral’s ancient organ before it starts playing. This will be followed by a service. The guest-list for the reopening ceremony has not yet been published, but one source familiar with the planning said US President Joe Biden’s wife Jill would come, while President-elect Donald Trump had not yet confirmed his attendance. First mass on Sunday, December 8 The archbishop will celebrate a Mass, starting at 10.30am (5.30pm Malaysian time), the first of eight days of Masses devoted to the reopening and focused on thanking, among others, donors who paid for the renovations and firefighters who helped save it. Some of the Masses, including on the evening of December 8, at 6.30pm, will be open to the public.   When can you visit? If you’re lucky, you can visit on the evening of December 8 from 5.30pm to 8.00pm but there is likely to be fierce competition — and long queues — to visit the cathedral. The cathedral says that from early December, visitors will be able to book a free ticket online, on its website, social media or a dedicated app, to get into the building on the same day or one or two days after booking. There will also be a queue on the spot for those who want to enter without a booking. Groups will only get access next year — from February 1 for religious groups or from June 9 for tourists with guides. The cathedral expects to welcome 14 to 15 million visitors every year. There is a huge debate in France over whether visitors should pay to get in. The Church is against it, and for now visiting remains free. How was the cathedral rebuilt? Money poured in from all over the world, including from French luxury sector billionaires Francois Henri Pinault and the Arnault family. So much money has been donated — more than 840 million euros (RM3.95 billion), according to Macron’s office — that there will even be funds left over for further investment in the building. The damage has needed five years’ worth of restoration work. What has changed? Officials say the cathedral will be more beautiful than ever, not only because its spire, roof and anything else destroyed by the fire was rebuilt by thousands of expert craftspeople, but also because the stone and paintings, which had blackened over the years, have been thoroughly cleaned. The furniture was also renovated and cleaned, or replaced. Not everything was damaged in the fire. For instance, emergency workers formed a human chain to whisk gem-studded chalices and other priceless artefacts out of harm’s way. — Reuters  "
2024-12-03,What’s next for Kamala Harris after historic White House bid falls short?,https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/11/30/whats-next-for-kamala-harris-after-historic-white-house-bid-falls-short/158459,"WASHINGTON, Nov 30 — For months US Vice President Kamala Harris was laser-focused on one potentially career-defining, history-making goal—becoming the first woman entrusted with the keys to the White House. But defeat to Donald Trump in November’s election stripped the Democrat of a place in the pantheon of US presidents, and left America wondering what’s next for a politician whose meteoric rise has come crashing to an abrupt halt. After spending a few days in Hawaii following the disappointment of November 5, the 60-year-old former prosecutor has begun lifting the veil on her future ambitions. “I am staying in the fight,” she declared during a call with party donors, without elaborating on how that might look. Washington is abuzz with speculation over Harris’s next move, with some commentators predicting a bid for the governor’s mansion in her home state of California when Gavin Newsom vacates the premises in 2026. In the United States, governorships are prestige positions, since many states are the size of countries—California’s economy would be the world’s fifth largest—and the men and women who run them act as quasi-presidents. A full term or two governing California—which has only ever been led by white men—would be a fitting culmination to a trailblazing career in which Harris has shattered multiple glass ceilings. She has longstanding relationships with local officialdom and much of the infrastructure already in place, as it was only seven years ago that she left the California attorney general’s office to become a US senator. But leading the country’s most populous state would also give Harris “an enormous platform” to reassert herself as a political heavyweight on the national stage, notes political scientist Julian Zelizer, a professor at Princeton University. Lost faith If Harris used statewide office as a springboard back to the top of the Democratic presidential ticket, she would be embarking on a well-worn route. Sixteen presidents have been governors before entering the White House, including Republican Ronald Reagan, one of the most popular, who ran California in the late 1960s and early 70s. But Democrats were faced with a painful reckoning after Harris lost every swing state and Trump made advances with practically every section of the electorate—and she is far from an automatic choice to lead her party into the next election. “The challenge is that once you lose, and are part of a loss this big, many in the party (lose) faith that you can win again in a big matchup,” Zelizer said. Two years as California governor would be considered an unusually short tenure in any case and some analysts believe that if Harris intends to run in the Golden State she would have to put off her presidential ambitions until at least 2032. Newsom, who has been California’s governor since 2019, has been identified as a potential Harris rival in four years, along with Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Another possible option for Harris would be to continue in politics without necessarily holding office. Democrat Bill Clinton’s vice-president Al Gore provides the exemplar, after losing to George W. Bush but remaining in public life anyway as an environmental crusader. In 2006, Gore’s documentary film “An Inconvenient Truth” played a major role in raising awareness of the rapid pace of global warming. Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007, the veteran Democrat is now training climate ambassadors around the world. — AFP  "

If you're one of those aspiring artists, know that it is possible to build a career, whether locally or beyond the borders. Ang Hor Kheng — a Malaysia-born freelance comic artist on a contract basis with Titan Comics or specifically, Winterfell LLC, owned by American writer Charles Ardai — is proof of that. With over thirty years of experience drawing comics-starting at just three-years-old, his love for comics, manga, and cartoon strips drove him to pursue his dream career. Ang said that he couldn’t afford at the time to learn to draw comics in art college, So he taught himself in his spare time, began as a part-time freelancer, saved up for an eight-month salary buffer before transitioning to full-time work. The success of Gun Honey Ang's most notable work is the comic seriesGun Honeyfirst published in 2022, where his illustrations bring to life Charles' gripping narrative. It gained international attention due to its compelling story, well-paired art, strong marketing, and covers by renowned artists like Adam Hughes and Artgerm. The series features a James Bond-like noir style that blends violence and sensuality, further fueling its popularity, along with the globe-trotting missions of the main character, Joanna Tan, across a fictional but familiar world. He credits the comic's success in Malaysia to the local support he received as the interior artist. Rated PG 18, the comic which caters to adults of all ages, boasts sales nearly equally distributed across different demographics. Ang spent nearly a year to draw and ink the first four issues. Following the exceptional sales of Volume 1, he was approached for a second volume, marking a significant step in his career. Apart fromGun Honey, Ang has provided artwork for various projects, includingPan,Hunt,Chicago Typewriter, andContract Graphic Novel, as well as illustrations for novels and tabletop games. ""My main is stillGun Honeybecause I believe Mr Charles to be an excellent writer and a great guy,” he said. A post shared by Ang Hor Kheng (@anghor99) Getting noticed internationally He said he got his introducing by showcasing his art on online platforms like DeviantArt and ArtStation, which cater to artists and creatives. ""I later found out that I was chosen from among two hundred artists,” said Ang, who also shares his artwork on his Instagram account. Advice for young comic artists For young, aspiring artists aiming to have their comics noticed by international companies, Ang advises that ""we have to approximate their standards as closely as we can,” — which often means imitating publishers' house styles. Artwork should not only look professional but also align with the genre and narrative that publishers seek, significantly improving the chances of being noticed. He emphasises that consistency is crucial for meeting deadlines, noting that artists must understand their limits and develop discipline regarding how long it takes to create a page and a standard 22-page issue. Clear communication is essential; he encourages maintaining an open dialogue about any challenges that may impact deadlines. While a degree in Arts, Graphic Design, or Fine Arts can be helpful, it’s not essential for working in the comic industry. What really matters is an artist's portfolio, so aspiring artists should make sure it showcases their best work. He emphasises the importance of storytelling, consistent character portrayal, and panel composition to help readers easily follow the story. ""For example, characters cannot look too different on page 1 compared to page 15; otherwise, our readers will have trouble following the narrative. ""Who is doing what, and why does the Asian girl suddenly look Caucasian on page 19? These should not happen."" Foreseeable future Ang plans to continue providing the art forGun Honey. However, he has various interests and may gradually explore different genres. ""For example, I may want to try science fiction or horror stories, or at least a couple of superhero stories. ""Fantasy, sword and sorcery are definitely on my list.” He is focused on discovering his painting style and experimenting with mixed media techniques. Ang believes that there are endless possibilities for artists once they break into the industry — and he feels that it has become easier for Malaysians in recent years. While Ang may not be the first, one thing is for sure — he won't be the last Malaysian comic artist to make waves.    "

He has since been discharged from hospital after receiving treatment for injuries to his face. A 37-year-old man, Basnayake Keith Spencer, was charged in court on November 11 over the incident. The Singaporean was handed one count of voluntarily causing grievous hurt with a dangerous weapon."
2024-12-03,Grab Singapore apologises after driver’s ‘S$5.70 ask Grab CEO to take you’ message goes viral,https://www.malaymail.com/news/singapore/2024/12/01/grab-singapore-apologises-after-drivers-s570-ask-grab-ceo-to-take-you-message-goes-viral/158569,"SINGAPORE, Dec 1 — Grab Singapore has issued an apology after one of its drivers sent a message rejecting a fare in a manner deemed unprofessional and rude. The driver’s response, which was made public online but has since been removed, read: “S$5.70 ask Grab CEO to take you.” The passenger said they had booked a JustGrab service for two people and a wheelchair. The fare for this trip was S$5.70 (about RM19). In Singapore, JustGrab, launched seven years ago, connects passengers to nearby drivers for fixed-fare rides. Passengers requiring wheelchair assistance should, however, opt for GrabAssist, where drivers are specially trained by the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC). Upon discovering the fare of S$5.70, the driver rejected the booking and added the inappropriate remark about the Grab CEO taking the passengers instead. In a statement to media siteMothership, Grab Singapore apologised on behalf of the driver, acknowledging that the response was inappropriate. The company confirmed that the driver admitted to making a mistake. Grab Singapore also highlighted that passengers should select the appropriate ride option based on their needs, as not all vehicles can accommodate large items like wheelchairs. “We are sorry for the unpleasant experience the passenger had with our driver-partner. This incident does not reflect the integrity and professionalism that the majority of our driver-partners uphold in accordance with our code of conduct,” Grab Singapore was quoted as saying. The company added that the driver, who has no prior offences, had been given a warning. “We would like to take this opportunity to remind both our driver-partners and passengers to treat each other with respect in all their interactions. They can contact Grab if they require assistance at any point in time,” Grab Singapore added."
2024-12-03,Singapore jails domestic helper nine months for abusing pet dog under employer’s orders,https://www.malaymail.com/news/singapore/2024/12/01/singapore-jails-domestic-helper-nine-months-for-abusing-pet-dog-under-employers-orders/158564,"SINGAPORE, Dec 1 — A domestic helper in Singapore was sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment on Tuesday for abusing a pet poodle, Boyboy, following her employer’s directives. Media outlet Channel News Asia (CNA) reported that Myanmar national Junny Lal Awn Pui, 26, was convicted of three counts of animal cruelty under the Animals and Birds Act. The abuse, captured on CCTV, showed Junny hitting Boyboy, a 15-year-old brown poodle, with her hand and a rod-like object and suspending it by its harness from a balcony railing. A veterinary report by the National Parks Board (NParks) concluded that the abuse likely caused the dog’s death, with prosecutors stating the blows caused “severe pain and suffering” and likely led to a fatal head injury. Court documents revealed that Junny had acted on the instructions of her employer, a 37-year-old woman referred to as Heng. Boyboy, owned by Heng’s boyfriend, only known as Lai, had been kept at Heng’s home, segregated from her other dogs, confined to the balcony, and fed separately. Heng instructed Junny to hit the dog if it ate without permission and created a rod from pet food packaging for this purpose. On January 22, Junny hit Boyboy multiple times and left it hanging from its harness in the sun to reduce its odour. Later that day, Boyboy was found motionless, bleeding, and twitching. It died shortly after. Heng arranged for the dog’s cremation but informed Lai of its death only after celebrating his birthday. Suspicious of the dog’s sudden death, Lai reviewed the CCTV footage and discovered the abuse, prompting a report to NParks. The case has raised questions about Heng’s accountability, with NParks yet to confirm if action will be taken against her."

Singapore’sStraits Timescited an MOM spokesman confirming that it is investigating the chain and its personnel for potentially violating employment laws concerning foreign workers. It also cited the spokesman saying MOM “takes a serious view on illegal employment”. The paper’s checks revealed that over 10 ABC Nasi Kandar outlets, previously located across areas like Little India, Lavender, and Eunos, have closed in recent months. It reported that at its Serangoon Road branch, located near City Square Mall, the premises appeared abandoned, with equipment removed and signage changed to “under renovation.” Workers nearby claimed the outlets shut down abruptly about two months ago, leaving the sites either boarded up or replaced by other businesses. The chain’s Desker Road branch, adjacent to Mustafa Centre, displayed a notice indicating plans for a revamp, stating it would reopen in late 2024. The investigation also included visits to the registered address of the restaurant’s director, where no occupants were found, and legal notices were observed on the premises. Under Singaporean law, hiring foreign workers without valid work passes can result in fines of up to S$30,000 (RM99,500), imprisonment for up to 12 months, or both, with harsher penalties for repeat offences. Meanwhile, foreigners who work without valid work passes may be fined up to $20,000, jailed for up to two years, or both."

Describing it as “one of the more serious food poisoning cases in recent years,” SFA stated it would ""take appropriate enforcement actions"" against the parties responsible but did not specify the measures or name those involved, as reported by media outlet Channel News Asia (CNA). SFA said two caterers, Yun Hai Yao and Pu Tien Services, were directed to dispose of all prepared food following the outbreak. Their operations at Yun Hai Yao’s Northpoint City restaurant and Pu Tien’s Senoko catering kitchen were suspended on July 31, it added, but reinstated on August 10 and 16, respectively, after compliance with food safety measures. Pu Tien retained some inventory after receiving SFA’s exemption, as further testing showed no food safety concerns. SFA also required both caterers to conduct cleaning, sanitisation, and staff retraining to meet food hygiene standards. Pu Tien also sent food samples from the day of the incident for third-party testing, which confirmed the absence of listeria and salmonella. The Ministry of Health (MOH) and SFA reported gastroenteritis symptoms among ByteDance staff who had consumed food at the 26th-floor canteen. ByteDance clarified that the food was supplied by licensed vendors and not prepared on-site. Under Singapore’s food hygiene laws, offenders face fines of up to S$2,000 (RM6,637), with additional penalties for continuing violations. ByteDance is a global tech giant and parent company of TikTok. Its Singapore office serves as a regional hub for its operations in South-east Asia, focusing on business development, content moderation, and marketing."

The Ministry of Health (MOH) said the kits, which involve self-collection of oral specimens using a swab, will also be available at Action for AIDS (AfA), a non-governmental organisation dedicated to fighting HIV infection and AIDS in the country. “HIV self-testing was piloted by the Department of Sexually Transmitted Infections Control (DSC) Clinic and AfA from August 2022 to complement existing testing modalities. “The pilot demonstrated the acceptability, safety and effective use of HIV self-testing, and it encouraged uptake among those who had never previously tested for HIV,” the MOH said in a statement yesterday. The ministry noted that the results of a single rapid diagnostic test, such as the HIV self-testing kit, are not sufficient to diagnose HIV infection. Individuals who test positive using the self-testing kit should undergo further confirmatory testing with a healthcare provider and be referred for treatment. “If the test result is negative but the individual has had recent unprotected sexual exposure or is at a higher risk for HIV infection, it may take up to three months for antibodies to HIV to develop and be detectable by the testing kit. Repeat HIV testing is advisable,” the MOH said. According to the MOH, a large portion of newly detected HIV cases in Singapore were diagnosed at a late stage, with 52 per cent of them diagnosed in late-stage infection in 2023, 51 per cent in 2022, and 62 per cent in 2021. In addition, the proportion of cases detected through self-initiated HIV testing remained relatively low, with 15 per cent in 2023, 17 per cent in 2022, and 16 per cent in 2021. The MOH and the Health Promotion Board recommend that every adult should be tested for HIV at least once in their lifetime, regardless of their risk factors. Individuals who engage in high-risk sexual behaviours should undergo regular HIV testing every three to six months, it added. — Bernama"

2024-12-03,Abolishing exams to reduce student stress?,https://www.malaymail.com/news/opinion/2024/12/02/abolishing-exams-to-reduce-student-stress/158623,"DECEMBER 2 –– The recent explanation from the government that some primary and secondary school exams, namely the UPSR and PTS, will remain abolished in order to reduce students’ stress is, as no doubt many educators will tell you, not ideal.  Sure, the move may curtail some anxiety. Sure, the refocused emphasis on inquiries, exploration, experience, contextual study etc will surely open more minds. And sure the country will save a lot more paper as a whole (smile). But ultimately, I’m not convinced this is the best way forward. Because unless students never have to sit foranyexams whatsoever in their lifetime, this strikes me as simply delaying the inevitable. I also think that exams, despite all their superficiality and questionable recall value, remain a sort of “baseline” that every student should experience.   Not unlike how learning one’s scales and arpeggios is necessary if for no other reason that one has undergone something that generations before have (again, yes, it’s controversial, but we should always think twice before chucking away something that’s been around for centuries). Nevertheless, I think the biggest issue isn’t the existence of examsper se, it’s our attitude towards academic learning and “success in life” as a whole. If students were taught to love their subjects and enjoy learning as a whole, the assessment method itself will be (almost) secondary. It’s ironic that even in cases where “group learning” or “active learning” is present, students may still feel hyper-pressured to succeed because academia remains a locus of “status achievement” as opposed to learning fulfilment. So, as I see it, the first problem is this mindset where academic competitiveness meets young adult social ranking,where the school is seen as a place to obtain prestige and standing in the (teenage) world. That’s the #1 source of pressure, NOT which question will come out in the Physics exam. Deal with this obsession with “standing out”, address this fear of being “seen as a failure” and voila students won’t have to worry about exams any more than being the last one to finish reading Harry Potter. Having said that, by all means let’s give credit where credit is due. For the Education Ministry to put more attention to non-rote methods of teaching and learning is certainly a plus. If nothing else it opens up students to more diverse ways of understanding and grappling with subjects. Hopefully such approaches will also communicate the joy of discussion, discovery, design and what-not. So perhaps there should be some rethinking on both sides. The Ministry needs to understand that exams aren’t the problem and parents need to see that they also aren’t the solution. Likewise, we can celebrate the fresh moves from the ministry without necessarily endorsing everything they do. Finally, for the sake of our children, we should absolutely remind them that their report card –– regardless of which assessment method or pedagogical approach was used to obtain the marks –– is by far NOT the most important thing in the world. * This is the personal opinion of the columnist.

2024-12-03,‘Gladiator II’ and ‘Death Whisperer 2’: A tale of two sequels,https://www.malaymail.com/news/opinion/2024/12/01/gladiator-ii-and-death-whisperer-2-a-tale-of-two-sequels/158521,"DEC 1 — There are many ways one can enjoy sequels, prequels and franchise films. The most obvious way is to be tuned in to the larger narrative involving the films, which will enable you to catch the many acts of fan service that the filmmakers will usually cram into the film, making it an even more enjoyable experience, especially when compared to the one you’d get walking into the film with no prior knowledge of such things. There are also those with a more cynical point of view who see all this as nothing more than just another cash grab by the Hollywood studios, enjoying the act of identifying and pointing out the by-the-numbers plotting, lazy writing, sometimes hilariously phoned-In performances and often disinterested direction that usually plague these movies. It’s almost as if the studios knew that people will flock to see these movies anyway, regardless of their quality, so there really is no need to try so hard to make a good movie. It’s just my luck that two sequels — one a long-awaited sequel from Hollywood and the other a very quickly assembled sequel to a big Thai hit last year — opened within a week of each other in Malaysian cinemas recently, which gave me a chance to see if there’s a case to be made on how to make, and how not to make a sequel. Gladiator II Twenty-four years on from the Oscar-winning original film, in which the hero died a heroic death, who knew that Hollywood had it in them to conjure up a sequel? I’m sure that back then, when we saw how Gladiator ended, all of us would’ve had the same thought in our minds – that’s that then. Still, Ridley Scott had thought it wise to deliver to us a legacy sequel with Gladiator II, which now focuses on a character named Lucius Verus (a shockingly charismatic Paul Mescal, especially after what we saw of him inAftersun), who is revealed to be the son of Maximus (Russell Crowe’s character in the original film), and who is hellbent on revenge against Roman General Marcus Acacius (Pedro Pascal), who he blames for the death of his wife during the film’s opening action set-piece. After his army lost the battle in that opening scene, Lucius was captured and enslaved and eventually ends up becoming a gladiator for Macrinus (Denzel Washington chewing up every bit of scenery he’s in and stealing the whole damn picture in the process). It’s a nice enough setup, but for whatever reasons known only to Scott and writer David Scarpa,Gladiator IIrepeats so many of the plot points of the original film that you’ll start to question whether this is actually a disguised and glorified remake instead of the legacy sequel that is poses to be. The acts of fan service here are so blatant, that the film even resorts to using footage from the original film, a lot! It still answers one question, “Are you not entertained,” famously asked in the original film, in the affirmative. I’m just not sure if that’s enough reason to make a sequel. Death Whisperer 2 WhileGladiator IIdefinitely makes a strong case for being another Hollywood cash grab, it’s quite hilarious that it took another obvious cash grab, but this time from Thailand, to show us how to properly make one. The originalDeath Whisperermade THB502 million (RM65 million) from a THB20 million budget in 2023, so of course a sequel would make total sense business-wise. It’s just quite shocking that a sequel arrived just a year later, and even more shocking that it has so far collected THB800 million in Thailand, overtaking the year’s breakout hitHow To Make Millions Before Grandma Dies, making it the highest grossing Thai film of 2024 so far. How did this happen? For once, director Taweewat Wantha made the bold decision not to repeat the formula and shenanigans of the first film. The characters and main ghost are still the same, so we get the same good-looking family and siblings all with names that begin with the letter “Y” like Yak, Yod, Yad and Yos, all a little bit older a year after the tragic events of the first film, which killed their middle sister Yam, who was possessed by a ghost named Tee Yod. The hunky Yak (Nadech Kugirniya from The Con-Heartist) has always suspected that Tee Yod would return to haunt their family, and has been on a ghost hunting expedition to get rid of Tee Yod once and for all, taking him and returning character Sarge Paphan into a demon/ghoul forest named Dong Khomot, which makes this part of the film kind of like something resembling the brutal action of Predator, but with ghouls and demons instead of aliens. Happening concurrently is the impending marriage of their oldest sister Yad at a hotel, which makes this part of the film something likeThe Shining, but with Thai ghosts and lore. It’s such a refreshing approach to making a sequel, that even if it’s a bit derivative in terms of inspiration, the way it’s all mashed up together to make it local and unmistakably Thai is what makes it such an entertaining watch, which is probably why people have been flocking to see it. If the filmmakers keep going like this, I definitely wouldn’t mind aDeath Whisperer 3next year as well! * This is the personal opinion of the columnist.  "
2024-12-03,Over clever workers: Malaysia’s grad job wobble,https://www.malaymail.com/news/opinion/2024/11/28/over-clever-workers-malaysias-grad-job-wobble/158238,"NOVEMBER 28 — About two million Malaysiansare employed below theirqualifiedstation. According to the department of statistics earlier this month. Underemployed, overeducated, disrespected or not given their worth. Various ways to call it. Whichever way referred to they constitute 37 per cent — more than a third — of the tertiary educated employed in the Malaysian economy. Like the digital animation graduate working for a small print shop in Kluang, helping elderly aunts choose fonts for their daughters and sons’kenduriinvitation cards. It’s soul-crushing to spend years trained in advanced animation software, termed promising by instructors, and then end up in the back of a sub-rented office unit in a derelict shop-lot block. Designing invites for Nornizran and Dayang’s wedding, while daydreaming about an alternate universe where this savant leads a team to produce Malaysia animation movie. There is nothing to be ashamed about work, regardless of pay, title or advancement. Being employed is a world better than being unemployed.   Yet to feel underutilised or underpaid is not a feeling which goes away easily. A feeling shared by far too many in Malaysia currently. To stay in class longer, only to earn less than earlier quitters because they clocked work years punches ambition in the gut. Apparently, a PhD is less valuable than five years on a work-floor. Or the graduated museum curator moonlighting too long as a club bouncer. That the only art he has left is to tell fake IDs. Every year the trained candidate is kept away from his career job, by the year, the training and qualification degrades, eventually to irrelevance. Are there answers to this predicament? It’s not local and it’s not going away It’s important to recognise Malaysia is not the lone country with this affliction. All countries which successfully invest in public education, target more graduates and facilitate state loans end up with more outputs regardless of whether the economy grows parallelly to absorb them. The United Kingdom’s Office for National Statistics reported 31 per cent of employees were overeducated for their jobs in 2017, swerving up from 20 per cent in 1992. It’s only likely the needle has trudged in the same direction in 2024. The victims are usually from the arts and humanities. The politicians suggest there are quick fixes, when there are none present. In Malaysia, it is about TVET retraining as a means to employment. But perhaps the more obvious answer. Supply has overwhelmed. The grass is greener India had a far more direct even if organic solution since the 70s and 80s. Leave the country. If the desired jobs are not prevalent even if the training for the said job is abundantly available, then the reasonable course of action is to thank the alma mater post-graduation and head abroad. To the United States and other developed countries, they went. Most thrived as technology workers at a time technologies bloomed. Today, America’s richest community is South Asians and they set roots only in the last fifty years. Cynically, in the trio of purpose, money can eclipse the need to be recognised or utilised as per training. For several decades, thousands of Filipino doctors migrated to the United States to become nurses. Due to the pay package. While Filipino doctors in their home country earn on average below US$1,000 (RM4,440) per month, when downgraded as nurses in the United States they earn an average of US$7,000 a month. The math does the explaining. The political springboard Human Resources Minister Steven Sim countered that the underemployment numbers are overstated. While at the same time, the PTPTN fund which pays for most local studentscontemplatesending loans for courses with low repayment (below 50 per cent). Since RM32 billion is owing, PTPTN wants to cut its losses. The huge hole in the company’s finances weakens the minister’s rebuttal. Those from low-prospect degrees are part of the two million who get paid much less and therefore largely incapacitated to repay student loans. PTPTN’s remarks betray their own poor assessment of our present and future graduates’ chances to better jobs. Though, them cutting ties with poorer courses means they shut down weak institutions as those centres rely solely on PTPTN to record profits. The one good outcome from otherwise a depressing situation. Why bother? It’s a convoluted subject matter, which ends up a poisoned chalice. All parties present their excuses so that they avoid blame and walk away. It matters a lot because many also expect their education to lift them up. From the PPR government housing to the condo. This problem is set to stay, the only part to work on is how to respond. Oversupply remains, as do opportunities abroad. Reorganising one’s skills to the market especially through TVET is a viable path but not a guarantee. Since the factors shift at so many levels and frequently, the fighting chance for young people as they compete with each other for the quality jobs left or they themselves create quality jobs is to take charge. Sounds simple, and a tad bit condescending but a lot of our young wait for the opportunity to be presented to them, and flagged. And expect a degree of cajoling. Otherwise, they’d take what is convenient or easy to get. Boutique assistant, motorbike deliverer. They may be fatalist because their training never made them own the situation or their futures. Maybe the real oversell is their qualifications. They feel the paper salvages them rather than convinced they are the product, with or without the paper. A lot are resigned, but not all. The go getters and sloggers are getting on just fine. Good for the inspired but how about the two million? * This is the personal opinion of the columnist."
2024-12-03,Pricking my fingers daily made me feel sorry for diabetics,https://www.malaymail.com/news/opinion/2024/11/27/pricking-my-fingers-daily-made-me-feel-sorry-for-diabetics/158144,"NOV 27 — How does suffering change people? I think having to deal with taking multiple blood sugar readings a day for the past few weeks has made me empathise more with people whose lives depend on it. It feels like such a racket, these super cheap blood glucose meters, that need you to buy the refills just like how inkjet printers are cheap but you’ll spend so much more over time on ink. The big difference is that choosing not to use my printer isn’t going to affect my health. Single-use glucose strips can cost anywhere from RM35-RM80 for a box of 50 and you can’t use them interchangeably between brands or devices. Continuous glucose monitors are so much more convenient but, alas, they’re just too expensive for most Malaysians as you’re paying RM200 or so every 14 days. When every sen counts I looked online for what people were thinking about glucose meters and the whole experience, and found people who were eager to share tips. The brand I’m using costs more but has a very good app unlike cheaper alternatives. Being able to sync my glucose readings to my Health app as opposed to entering them manually is convenient and lets me look at trends such as how what I eat or what I do (exercise, sleep, eat carbs) affects my blood sugar. For other people, though, that extra is too much so they trade the data for savings because they need to spend money on other things such as diabetes medication. Some even spoke about other things they did to save money on glucose tests such as reusing lancets despite it being more sanitary to change them with each use as well as their losing sharpness with each use. Different versions of hell This year I’ve seen more doctors than I have in the last five years. The surgeon I saw for a second opinion quipped, after seeing my blood pressure records on my phone, that I seem allergic to doctor’s offices. I don’t like hospitals; I hate the thought of being hooked up to an IV, remembering when, a long time ago, my IV line was blocked and a callous nurse, when called, did nothing more than snap her finger on it — causing me more pain. It took a whole day for another nurse to finally fix my IV after I’d laid awake most of the night in pain. I’d switched hospitals for the second time after my experience at my previous hospital was rather lacking, the doctor seeming too rushed, the admissions getting my procedure and its date wrong (listing it as an ordinary mammogram instead of a biopsy). Perhaps it was just a busy day and the timing was off, but I decided that perhaps I needed a different hospital. This time my doctor, a surgeon, took his time asking me questions about my health, patiently looking at my blood pressure and explaining to me a finding that my previous doctor had failed to mention. There were breast calcifications spotted in my mammogram that the first hospital where I took my mammogram did not mention, neither did the other doctor I saw for a second opinion. It was an important detail because while they are common, their presence, and their size and placement are indicators of possible breast cancer or precancerous changes to tissue. My new doctor also advised a biopsy and said that the findings report would take several days, but reassured me by saying, “It’s better that it takes time to make sure they don’t miss anything.” What happens when I do get my results is a problem for future me. Right now, there is no point in worrying because what will be, as that old Doris Day song says (which I don’t think Gen Z even knows), will be.   No epiphanies here I think my time at various hospitals mattered. Besides the obvious — it made great column fodder — it made me think about, beyond my own health, the state of things where healthcare is concerned. If I felt overwhelmed at times dealing with my health issues, what must it be like for other people? At times I had moments of stress crying because of all the decisions I needed to make so if it felt hard for me, it has to be harder for a lot of Malaysians. “What do I do?” I see that question online, on message boards, on social media. What will I do with this experience? I want to find out more about the things that are working, what people can do besides what they can’t. I also want to believe we will figure something out in the next few years to deal with future healthcare needs. There are still stories to tell, and people to help, whatever tests may come because in the end isn’t that life? On to the next healthcare adventure. "

2024-12-03,AI and the new era of human trafficking — Haezreena Begum Abdul Hamid,https://www.malaymail.com/news/what-you-think/2024/12/03/ai-and-the-new-era-of-human-trafficking-haezreena-begum-abdul-hamid/158736," DEC 3 — Human trafficking is the movement of human beings mostly for forced labour, sexual exploitation, organ buying or forced criminality which impacts millions of people worldwide. With the looming growth of technology and multimedia, traffickers have increasingly turned to social media and other online platforms to locate, groom, and recruit potential victims, advertise and sell them, transfer illicit funds, and even monitor their victims. Additionally, traffickers exploit internet technologies to directly harm victims, leading to the emergence of “cyber-trafficking” —a new form of trafficking where victims are exploited through online means. Cyber-trafficking is further exacerbated by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies which allow traffickers to manipulate appearances and identities making it easier for them to evade detection and continue to exploit people. Some traffickers use AI to automate and expand their scope of operations, targeting vulnerable individuals through online platforms and social media. For example, AI-powered social media algorithms enable traffickers to reach potential victims with deceptive ads (e.g., fake job offers, romantic schemes, etc.) while maintaining anonymity. They can also use deepfake technology to create falsified images or videos of victims for online commercial sex markets and pornography. These images are often graphic, disturbing, and non-consensual. Traffickers also use deepfake images and videos to deceive victims by impersonating a prominent figure to gain their confidence and trust. This method is often used for job scams and sex trafficking. While the rise of AI has profoundly being used by criminal organisations and traffickers to sustain their network and operate sophisticatedly, it has also offered law enforcement agencies new tools to counter human trafficking. Hence, law enforcement agencies has increasingly adopted AI technologies in their quest to counter human trafficking. This is definitely a progressive step in enhancing their investigations and intercepting the modus operandi of trafficking operations. For example, AI would be able to analyse message histories shared in online chatrooms or between traffickers and buyers or traffickers and victims or investigate video footage and photos for signs of trafficking which has proven to be labour intensive and cumbersome when carried out the traditional way. With the advancement of technologies, AI can perform these tasks and reduce the strain on labour while minimising the psychological burden on law enforcers who are under intense pressure to rescue victims. However, the effectiveness of using AI for countering human trafficking remains uncertain and raises ethical and legal concerns, risking potential harms to victims of trafficking. These harms include but not limited to potential violation of data privacy and AI biases that create discriminatory outcomes. As of now, the Malaysian Parliament is yet to pass a bill to address human trafficking cases that involve explicit images created through deepfake technology, or a bill that comprehensively addresses AI-enabled human trafficking cases. Unlike the European Union who has launched its legislation for AI on 12 July 2024, namely the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act) which came into force on 1 August 2024, Malaysia’s anti-human trafficking laws and regulatory frameworks remains inadequate due to the rapid development of AI. Existing laws such as the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Migrant Smuggling Act 2007 (ATIPSOM), Penal Code, Child Act 1991, Sexual Offences Act 2017, Immigration Act 1959/53 focus primarily on traditional trafficking methods. The ATIPSOM and Penal Code for example, does not address anonymized trafficking operations, AI-manipulated images and identities, and the exploitation of global digital platforms. Even the Evidence Act 1950 does not accurately capture AI technology and its inventions under section 90 of the Act (which allows the admissibility of documents produced by computers, and of statements contained therein). What we can currently rely on for now is the extra-territorial nature of the EU AI Act which governs the development, deployment, supply, and use of AI systems based on the risk level of the systems. Article 2(1)(a) of the Act states that “the EU AI Act applies to providers placing on the market or putting into service AI systems or GPAI models in the EU, irrespective of whether those providers are established or located within the EU or in a third country.” In this instance, Malaysian entities may be affected, for instance, if they (with or without a physical presence in the EU) make the output of an AI system available for use in the EU. However, the EU AI Act does not apply to AI systems used for military, defence, national security, or personal use. Given the lacuna in law relating to the use of AI, it is imperative for the Malaysian government to decide on culpability, entity, and methods of prosecution when it involves AI. Who can we place the blame on if the traffickers uses chatbot, deepfake images, video or AI related technologies to deceive, coerce or abuse the vulnerability of a person? Can we then call this an “offenderless” crime or do we penalise the programmer for his/her inherent role which tantamount to a breach of natural justice. At present, laws are enforceable by and against legal persons only. Within this context, human beings, states, businesses, professional bodies, companies and corporations are legal persons and can be brought to court. Can we now consider machines themselves as legal persons? But how can we establish the intention of the robot? Could a robot claim defence currently available to people such as diminished responsibility, provocation, self-defence, necessity, mental disorder or intoxication should it begin to malfunction or make flawed decisions? At the moment, there is no recognition of robots as legal persons – so they cannot currently be held liable or culpable for any wrongdoings or harm caused to anyone. In conclusion, AI has become a double-edged sword in the context of human trafficking. While it offers traffickers new tools to expand their operations, it also empowers law enforcement with the ability to detect and dismantle trafficking networks more efficiently. AI and algorithms also has the potential to enhance various aspects of criminal justice decision-making. However, lawmakers need to update and amend the current anti-human trafficking legal frameworks to effectively counter human trafficking. New laws and regulations should focus on utilizing AI while eliminating privacy infringements and biased nature of AI. It should also include situations of “offenderless” crime in situations where it is hard to detect the traffickers. The law as it stands now lacks clarity. Therefore, it is imperative for states to not only embrace the use of AI in countering human trafficking but also address the culpability of AI when used in trafficking operations.

2024-12-03,Malaysia’s pivot: Navigating Trump’s return for growth and stability — Ashurov Sharofiddin and Syed Marwan Mujahid Syed Azman,https://www.malaymail.com/news/what-you-think/2024/12/03/malaysias-pivot-navigating-trumps-return-for-growth-and-stability-ashurov-sharofiddin-and-syed-marwan-mujahid-syed-azman/158731,"DECEMBER 3 — The 45th US President, Donald Trump, is set to return to the White House as the 47th President following his victory in the recent US presidential election. Countries across Asia including Malaysia, are recalibrating their economic and strategic approaches. With the possibility of significant changes in U.S. policy on trade and security, Malaysia stands at a crossroads. How can the country leverage its strengths to navigate potential disruptions while positioning itself to benefit economically, socially and on the global stage? Economic challenges and opportunities Trump’s strong rhetoric and policies targeting China, marked by promises of sweeping tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese imports, have raised alarm bells throughout Asia. For Malaysia, which counts both China and the U.S. as critical trading partners, these developments present a complex scenario. The implications could be significant as the ramifications will affect supply chains, market demand and economic confidence across the region. Malaysia, with its diverse economic base and strategic location, has opportunities to mitigate potential disruptions and capitalize on new openings. If U.S.-China tensions escalate further into a full-scale trade war, Malaysia could take the opportunity to strengthen its position as an alternative production and trade hub that attracts investments from multinational companies who are looking to diversify away from China. This strategic pivot could strengthen Malaysia’s role in global supply chains and enhance its economic resilience. Strengthening regional trade and economic partnerships Malaysia’s proactive participation in regional trade agreements like the RCEP strengthens its economic resilience by reducing reliance on single economies and fostering regional integration. With Malaysia set to chair ASEAN in 2025, it can leverage this leadership to diversify trade beyond the U.S.-China dynamic. In October 2024, Malaysia joined BRICS as a partner alongside Thailand and Indonesia, signaling a strategic expansion in global alliances and reinforcing its independent, non-aligned stance. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim views BRICS as a platform for “economic opportunities free from external pressures,” aligning Malaysia with the “Global South” for greater resilience amid geopolitical shifts. Malaysia’s strategic location along the Straits of Malacca, a vital energy route, complements BRICS’ significant share in global oil production. As an OIC member, Malaysia’s dual alignment with BRICS and Islamic nations broadens its market access, economic stability, and influence in a multipolar world. Key strengths for economic leverage Malaysia’s economic strength lies in its diverse sectors, from electronics and palm oil to an expanding focus on tourism. To stay competitive globally, innovation in green energy and digital technology is crucial. As a leader in the halal economy and Islamic finance, Malaysia leverages its ethical finance expertise, backed by Value-Based Intermediation (VBI), to attract investment and promote sustainable growth. Situated along major shipping routes, Malaysia’s strategic location boosts its potential as a trade and logistics hub. Streamlining customs and trade policies is vital to enhance its appeal as a global trade partner, strengthening its economic resilience, especially amid U.S.-China trade tensions. The shift toward digital transformation presents Malaysia with an opportunity to lead Southeast Asia’s digital economy. Supporting tech startups and fostering innovation are essential to attract investors. Leveraging these strengths, Malaysia can navigate global uncertainties and secure its place as a key international player. Social and cultural diplomacy Malaysia’s diverse cultural fabric is a unique strength that it can emphasize to foster social cohesion and promote itself as an attractive destination for tourism and international cooperation. Highlighting Malaysia’s multicultural society enhances its image as an inclusive and cooperative partner on the global stage, which is particularly valuable in a world increasingly conscious of diversity and intercultural engagement. Security concerns and regional stability in ASEAN Trump’s stance on Taiwan has prompted Asian nations, including Malaysia, to reassess security policies and alliances. With Trump’s approach suggesting allies should contribute more to defense, U.S. support dynamics could change. For Malaysia, maintaining South China Sea stability is vital due to its role as a major trade route for ASEAN, where disruptions could impact economies. The South China Sea dispute, involving overlapping claims by China and ASEAN members, remains a delicate issue that could challenge China-ASEAN relations. Malaysia must prioritize ASEAN unity for peace and stability while balancing relations with China. To navigate these tensions without being drawn into conflicts, Malaysia’s non-alignment and neutrality are essential. Strengthening ASEAN ties allows for a collective stance on security and trade, enhancing regional stability. Concurrently, Malaysia should balance engagements with both China and the U.S., fostering diplomacy that prioritizes peace and shared benefits, ensuring its influence and stability in an uncertain geopolitical landscape. The road ahead As the return of Donald Trump to the White House raises questions about U.S. trade and security policies, Malaysia should draw on its strengths to navigate this new landscape. By emphasizing economic diversification, strengthening regional and global partnerships, and promoting innovation and sustainability, Malaysia can position itself not just as a resilient nation but as a leading force in Southeast Asia. Balancing economic opportunities and geopolitical realities will be essential for Malaysia to thrive amid shifting global dynamics. With strategic foresight and adaptability, Malaysia can turn challenges into opportunities and secure its place as a significant economic and diplomatic player on the world stage. — By Associate Professor Dr. Ashurov Sharofiddin, Assistant Professor Dr. Syed Marwan Mujahid Syed Azman The authors are from IIUM Institute of Islamic Banking and Finance (IIiBF), and may be reached at[email protected]and[email protected] * This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views ofMalay Mail.

2024-12-03,"Johor civil service is making headlines, let’s not forget women’s roles — Ng Kor Sim",https://www.malaymail.com/news/what-you-think/2024/12/02/johor-civil-service-is-making-headlines-lets-not-forget-womens-roles-ng-kor-sim/158674,"DECEMBER 2 — The Johor civil service has been in the news recently. Changes such as the return to a Saturday-Sunday weekend and the proposed four-and-a-half-day work week in government agencies have sparked media interest. These changes are exciting, but they should not distract us from another important issue —women’s participation in the civil service. According to the Department of Statistics, women make up nearly half of Malaysia’s population (48.93 per cent in 2023). Despite this, they hold fewer than 30 per cent of executive positions in government. While these numbers reflect a national trend, it is likely that Johor mirrors this imbalance based on anecdotal experience. This underrepresentation isn’t just about numbers — it’s about missed opportunities. Women bring unique perspectives to decision-making. They often focus on policies that benefit families, education, healthcare, and community welfare. These areas are critical to building a stronger society, and having more women in leadership roles can make a real difference. Research also shows that women are more likely to lead with empathy and are more collaborative. These leadership styles foster better teamwork and transparency, which are essential in public service.   Based on personal experience as a wakil rakyat who has to often deal with bureaucrats, I must say that having gender-diverse organisations is definitely a plus point. A more inclusive civil service can also boost the economy. When more women join the workforce, productivity rises, and economic growth accelerates. Gender diversity isn’t just good for society, it’s smart economics. Some may wonder if inclusivity compromises meritocracy. On the contrary, inclusivity enhances meritocracy by ensuring that no talent is overlooked due to outdated biases. A more diverse and inclusive civil service strengthens public service delivery. Yet, challenges remain. Women continue to face barriers to leadership, whether due to outdated mindsets, a lack of mentorship, or rigid workplace policies. This is where Johor can make a difference. Johor has always been a leader in governance. Under Sultan Sir Abu Bakar in the late 19th century, Johor became the first Malay state to modernise its civil service. Today, we still see the legacy of his reforms in the institutions and systems we rely on. It’s time to carry this legacy forward by championing gender inclusivity. So, what can we do? First, we need clear goals. The Johor government can set targets to increase women’s representation in senior roles, with specific timelines to measure progress. Second, mentorship programmes can play a key role. Women in junior positions need guidance and support to rise to leadership roles. Experienced leaders can provide this mentorship, creating a pipeline of talented women ready to lead. Third, the government should explore flexible work policies. Balancing work and family responsibilities remains a challenge for many women to break the glass ceiling. By implementing policies that support work-life balance, more women will feel encouraged to join and remain in the workforce. Doing these does not mean that we compromise on meritocracy. In fact we should foster even greater meritocracy in the civil service to enhance the public delivery system. A civil service that values diversity and meritocracy is better equipped to serve the needs of all its citizens. As an ADUN, I see firsthand the potential of women in leadership. Their contributions are invaluable, and their voices must be heard. But this isn’t just about equality — it’s about building a better society for everyone. When we empower women, we empower families, communities, and the economy. Johor has the opportunity to lead by example. By addressing gender gaps in the Johor Civil Service, we can inspire other states to follow. This is something I have brought up during my debate at the State Assembly sitting recently. Let’s seize this moment to ensure that the civil service reflects the diversity, talent, and aspirations of our people. * Ng Kor Sim is the state assemblywoman for Jementah, Johor. ** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views ofMalay Mail.

2024-12-03,Looking beyond Gen Z’s resume — Ts Elman Mustafa El Bakri,https://www.malaymail.com/news/what-you-think/2024/12/02/looking-beyond-gen-zs-resume-ts-elman-mustafa-el-bakri/158672,"DECEMBER 2 — As 2024 draws to a close, many companies find themselves ramping up their recruitment efforts to prepare for the year ahead. Amid this rush, one question looms larger than ever: Are our hiring processes truly equipped to understand and capture the unique talents of Generation Z? Born between 1997 and 2012, Gen Z is no longer the “future” of the workforce; they are the present. And yet, much of the recruitment world continues to rely on traditional methods — resumes, interviews, and rigid academic qualifications — that fail to tap into the full potential of this digitally savvy, values-driven generation. If businesses are serious about future-proofing their workforce, they need to look beyond these outdated markers of competency and rethink how they assess and hire Gen Z talent. The problem with traditional hiring The problem starts with a tool as old as the hiring process itself: the resume. While resumes can provide a snapshot of past achievements, they often fail to capture what really matters in today’s fast-evolving work environment — creativity, adaptability, and a willingness to learn. Gen Z, for example, thrives on projects that demand cross-disciplinary thinking and digital innovation. A resume listing past internships or GPA scores might not fully convey the entrepreneurial spirit of a Gen Z worker who has run a successful online store, created viral content, or coded an app in their free time.   Then there’s the interview, a cornerstone of recruitment that’s often seen as a definitive test of “fit.” The reality? Interviews tend to favor those who are naturally charismatic or well-versed in professional jargon, traits that may or may not correlate with job performance. For a generation accustomed to asynchronous communication and collaborative tools, the traditional one-on-one interview can feel more like a performance than an authentic conversation. And before we talk about solutions, it’s worth highlighting what Gen Z workers bring to the table. This generation has grown up in an era of rapid technological change and social activism. They are digital natives who not only understand emerging tools but also adapt to them quickly. Their early exposure to global issues like climate change, social justice, and mental health advocacy has instilled in them a desire to work with purpose. Gen Z values inclusivity, creativity, and growth. They aren’t just looking for jobs — they’re looking for roles where they can make an impact while continuously learning and evolving. Recognising and nurturing these qualities should be the goal of every forward-thinking hiring strategy. Rethinking the hiring process 1. Digital portfolios over resumes A Gen Z candidate’s portfolio — whether it’s a website, blog, GitHub repository, or social media profile — can say far more about their capabilities than a one-page resume ever could. Digital portfolios provide tangible proof of what they’ve created, managed, or innovated. For example, a portfolio showcasing video editing skills or app development projects speaks directly to their abilities, rather than relying on vague bullet points. 2. Gamified hiring processes Companies like Deloitte and Unilever have started incorporating gamified assessments into their recruitment strategies. These games measure cognitive abilities, decision-making skills, and even cultural fit in a way that feels engaging rather than intimidating. For Gen Z, who grew up on apps and games, this approach feels natural and allows their skills to shine in a less formal setting. 3. Leveraging AI and data-driven insights Artificial intelligence tools can analyse applications and portfolios to identify qualities that traditional methods might overlook. For example, an AI-driven system could assess writing samples, code, or designs, flagging candidates with exceptional potential based on their work rather than their credentials. 4. Reverse mentorship during hiring Consider incorporating reverse mentorship into the hiring process. Pair senior employees with Gen Z candidates during assessments, allowing both sides to exchange insights. This approach not only helps candidates feel valued but also gives the company a clearer picture of how they might fit into the team. In conclusion, to truly capture the potential of Gen Z workers, companies must first let go of the idea that hiring is a one-size-fits-all process. The businesses that thrive in the coming years will be those that recognise the need to evolve — adapting their recruitment methods to better understand and engage with this dynamic, tech-savvy generation. Gen Z isn’t just another group of employees; they represent a shift in how we think about work, purpose, and collaboration. By embracing their values and rethinking hiring processes, companies can not only attract top talent but also create workplaces that are more innovative, inclusive, and resilient. It’s time to move beyond resumes and interviews. Let’s build hiring processes that see Gen Z not as another checkbox to fill, but as equal partners in shaping the future of work. * The author is CEO and Founder of HESA Healthcare Recruitment Agency, and the Industrial Advisory Panel for the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Universiti Malaya.

US President Joe Biden’s administration is working against the clock to provide billions of dollars in aid to Kyiv before President-elect Donald Trump takes office, after which future assistance for Ukraine will be in doubt. Less than two months before Trump is set to be sworn in, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that the package was part of efforts “to ensure Ukraine has the capabilities it needs to defend itself against Russian aggression.” It includes anti-personnel landmines, ammunition for HIMARS precision rocket launchers, Stinger missiles, counter-drone systems, anti-armour weapons and artillery ammunition, Blinken said in a statement. The United States announced a first shipment of landmines to Ukraine last month -- a major policy shift slammed by rights groups. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said that the decision was necessitated by Russian forces leading with dismounted infantry units instead of vehicles. The Ukrainians “have a need for things that can help slow down that effort on the part of the Russians,” Austin told journalists last month. The outgoing US administration is working to get as much aid as possible to Ukraine before Trump -- who has repeatedly criticized US assistance for Kyiv, claiming he could secure a ceasefire within hours -- takes over the presidency. ‘Spend every dollar’ Trump’s comments have triggered fears in Kyiv and Europe about the future of US aid, and Ukraine’s ability to withstand Russian attacks in the absence of further American support. On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that his country needed security guarantees from NATO and more weapons to defend itself before any talks with Russia. Pentagon spokesman Major General Pat Ryder said Monday that all remaining US funding for Kyiv would be used. “At the president’s direction, we will spend every dollar that Congress has appropriated for Ukraine and to replenish our stockpiles,” Ryder told journalists. Speaking prior to the announcement of the latest package, he put the total aid that can still be drawn from US stockpiles at $6.8 billion, while more than $2.2 billion is available to procure weapons and equipment from the defence industry. Austin spoke on Monday with his Ukrainian counterpart Rustem Umerov, providing “an update on the continued surge of US security assistance to Ukraine to provide the capabilities it needs to defend against Russian aggression,” the Pentagon said. The United States has been a key military backer of Ukraine, committing more than $60 billion in weapons, ammunition and other security aid since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022. — AFP"
2024-12-03,‘This will be used against us’: Biden’s pardon of son Hunter sparks outrage even among allies over justice system integrity,https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/03/this-will-be-used-against-us-bidens-pardon-of-son-hunter-sparks-outrage-even-among-allies-over-justice-system-integrity/158747,"WASHINGTON, Dec 3 — Joe Biden’s pardon of his son Hunter has antagonised both sides of the US political divide, with Republicans crying hypocrisy and Democrats warning it undermines efforts to rein in Donald Trump. Biden’s announcement shocked Washington, after he entered the White House in 2021 vowing to restore the “integrity” of a justice system that Democrats said had been corrupted by Trump — and because he had specifically vowed not to reprieve his son. The president instead issued a “full and unconditional” pardon on Sunday, absolving 54-year-old Hunter Biden of any wrongdoing over the last decade, charged or otherwise, just ahead of his looming sentencing over gun and tax convictions. Biden argued that his son had been targeted in a politicised prosecution launched under the Trump administration and that “there’s no reason to believe it will stop here.” But the backlash from his own side was swift. “I know that there was a real strong sentiment and wanting to protect Hunter Biden from unfair prosecution,” Glenn Ivey, a Democratic congressman in Maryland and an attorney, told CNN. “But this is going to be used against us when we’re fighting the misuses that are coming from the Trump administration.” While politicians typically pay lip service to the importance of independent law enforcement, Democrats and Republicans offer different justifications for suspicion of the Justice Department and presidents of both stripes have protected allies. Trump wielded the pardon power liberally in favour of convicts with whom he had personal relationships, including his daughter’s father-in-law Charles Kushner, his friend Roger Stone and his 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort. ‘Singled out’ Biden announced Hunter’s pardon in a statement arguing that the charges against his son were brought in a process infected with “raw politics.” Hunter Biden was convicted by a jury in June of lying about his drug use when he bought a gun and pleaded guilty in a separate tax evasion trial in September. The president and his team had been adamant that he would not pardon his son, with White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre making the claim as recently as November 7. Charges for the gun offence are rare, and the president — in language that CNN likened to Trump’s rhetoric on law and order — argued that his own Justice Department had been wielded unfairly for political purposes. Seeking to justify his about-face, Biden said that “Hunter was singled out only because he is my son.” But Republicans argued that the pardon demonstrated that the sitting president, and not his incoming replacement, was politicising the system. “He’s leaving office in complete and total disgrace. He is a liar and there’s no other way to spin this today,” conservative political strategist Scott Jennings, a White House staffer under George W. Bush, told CNN. ‘Bad precedent’ Meanwhile Democrats worried that Trump would use Biden’s action to justify pardoning rioters jailed after the January 6, 2021 assault on the US Capitol. “Does the Pardon given by Joe to Hunter include the J-6 Hostages, who have now been imprisoned for years?” Trump wrote in a post on his platform, Truth Social, on Sunday. “Such an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!” Democratic Colorado Governor Jared Polis said Biden’s son had brought his legal woes on himself and accused the president of having “put his family ahead of the country.” “This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later Presidents and will sadly tarnish his reputation,” Polis posted on X. “When you become President, your role is Pater familias of the nation.” Political scientist Nicholas Creel, of Georgia College and State University argues however that nothing Biden does before leaving office will affect the actions of a successor who “simply does not care about precedent.” “Trump was never going to need an excuse to do whatever he wants once he takes office,” he told AFP. “So while I’m sure we’ll get plenty of pundits claiming that Biden pardoning his son opens the door for Trump to use his pardon power in overtly personal and political ways, I find it laughable that this wasn’t always going to be the case.” — AFP"
2024-12-03,How Syria’s devastated city of Aleppo returned to rebel hands,https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/03/how-syrias-devastated-city-of-aleppo-returned-to-rebel-hands/158745,"BEIRUT, Dec 3 — Aleppo had been slowly recovering from the wounds inflicted by more than a decade of civil war when forces loyal to Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad fled last week’s rebel onslaught. Apart from a few northern districts, most of the city — much of which had been devastated in the conflict — is now in the hands of Islamist-led rebels opposed to Assad. Here is how Aleppo has suffered since the civil war erupted in 2011, when Syria’s former economic and cultural capital had an estimated population of two million people. Wary Christians When the uprising began against Assad, there were about 200,000 Christians, including 50,000 ethnic Armenians, living in Aleppo, where the majority are Muslims. But that figure has since fallen to 30,000 Christians, a third of them Armenian, according to sources within the community. The arrival last week of the radical rebels, led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), caused huge concern among Christians in the city. HTS representatives have been to a convent and a hospital run by Christians in a bid to assure them of their safety, the community sources said. Divided and devastated Aleppo was an early venue for demonstrations against Assad in 2011 that turned into the civil war. By July 2012, the Syrian Free Army had taken half of the city. For four years, Aleppo was divided between a loyalist sector in the west — with most of the population — and rebels in a small zone in the east. The Syrian regime was accused of dropping “barrel bombs” from helicopters and other aircraft onto rebel areas. The insurgents fired rockets into government territory. Russia came to Assad’s assistance in September 2015, helping government forces to lay siege to the rebel zone by cutting off its last supply route. Government forces reclaimed complete control of the city on December 22, 2016 when a final convoy of rebels and civilians left eastern Aleppo. Heritage collapse A key stop on the Silk Route between the Mediterranean and Mesopotamia, Aleppo is one of the world’s oldest cities, dating back to 4,000 BC. As a manufacturing centre, it was still the second most important city in the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century. Aleppo’s old city was declared a UNESCO world heritage site in 1986. With the civil war raging, it was added to UNESCO’s endangered list in 2013. The damage to the city has been widespread. Part of Aleppo’s ancient ramparts collapsed in July 2015. The minaret on the Great Mosque of Aleppo was also destroyed. The Aleppo souk, with its 4,000 traders, was nearly burned down but has been partially rebuilt. Aleppo’s traditional music, Al-Qudoud al-Halabiya, is on UNESCO’s list of intangible cultural heritage. Performed at religious and entertainment events, it is often heard in the alleyways of the Old City. — AFP"
2024-12-03,Trump warns ‘hell to pay’ if Gaza hostages not freed before his inauguration,https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/03/trump-warns-hell-to-pay-if-gaza-hostages-not-freed-before-his-inauguration/158718,"WASHINGTON, Dec 3 — US President-elect Donald Trump yesterday warned Gaza militants of massive repercussions if hostages are not released by the time he takes office. The threat comes after exhaustive diplomacy by outgoing President Joe Biden’s administration that has so far failed to secure a deal that would both end Israel’s war in Gaza and free hostages seized 14 months ago. “If the hostages are not released prior to January 20, 2025, the date that I proudly assume Office as President of the United States, there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East, and for those in charge who perpetrated these atrocities against Humanity,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. “Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!” Trump has vowed staunch support for Israel and to dispense with Biden’s occasional criticism, but has also spoken of his desire to secure deals on the world stage. Hamas staged the deadliest ever attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. The assault resulted in 1,208 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Militants seized 251 hostages during the attack, some of whom were already dead. Of those, 97 are still held in Gaza, including 35 the army says are dead. Israel’s retaliatory campaign has killed 44,429 people in Gaza, according to figures from the territory’s health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable. — AFP  "
2024-12-03,"No Christmas in Bethlehem as war, exodus, and empty streets grip the Holy City",https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/03/no-christmas-in-bethlehem-as-war-exodus-and-empty-streets-grip-the-holy-city/158676,"BETHLEHEM, Dec 3 — For a second year running, there is no Christmas cheer in Bethlehem, with tourists shunning the Palestinian city and many residents seeking a way out as the Gaza war grinds on. Bethlehem’s Manger Square in front of the Church of the Nativity is largely deserted and souvenir shops are shuttered. Once again, there are no plans to put up the traditional light-festooned Christmas Tree in the ancient settlement that is venerated by Christians as the birthplace of Jesus and now sits in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. “During these difficult times that our Palestinian cities are going through, especially in the Gaza Strip, it is difficult to show any signs of joy and happiness,” said Issa Thaljieh, an Orthodox priest who ministers at the Nativity Church. Adding to the gloom, many local Christian families are also looking to escape, demoralised by both the tourist slump that has ravaged their economy, and the constant threat of violence hovering over the territory northeast of Gaza. “The emigration out of Bethlehem is increasing daily and monthly, and... this has a negative impact on the city,” Thaljieh said.   Christian communities have been in decline across the Middle East for generations, and the West Bank is no exception. In the last year of British rule over the region in 1947, some 85 per cent of Bethlehem’s population were Christian. As of a 2017 census, the overall population of Bethlehem was 215,514 with only 23,000 Christians among them. That puts the percentage of Christians in Bethlehem in 2017 at around 10 per cent. Locals say the rate of departure has been gathering steam in recent months in the cradle of Christianity, with the economic lifeblood of the city no longer flowing and the Israeli occupation preventing freedom of movement around the territory. Bethlehem resident Alaa Afteem, who runs a falafel restaurant, said one of his cousins had recently moved to Australia. “Due to the bad living conditions and bad financial conditions, people have started looking for better opportunities for their children, for better education, for a better future,” he told Reuters. ‘There is no security’ Since the 1967 war between Israel and neighbouring Arab countries, Israel has occupied the West Bank, which Palestinians want as the core of a future independent state. Israel has built Jewish settlements, deemed illegal by most countries, across the territory. Israel disputes this, citing historical and biblical ties to the land. Several of its ministers live in settlements and favour their expansion. Violence has surged across the hilly land since the start of the Hamas-Israel war in Gaza in October last year. Hundreds of — including armed fighters, stone-throwing youths and civilian bystanders — have died in clashes with Israeli security forces, while dozens of Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks, Israeli authorities say. Difficult at the best of times, travel between West Bank cities has become increasingly fraught. “There is no security if you are commuting between districts within the West Bank like between Bethlehem, Ramallah, Jericho, Hebron,” Afteem said.   Munther Isaac, a pastor at Bethlehem’s Lutheran Church, says local Muslim families have also been emigrating, squeezed by both financial problems and broader worries about the future. “(There is) the fear that this war might extend to areas in the West Bank, especially after the arming of the settlers and the announcement of the possible annexation of the West Bank,” he said. The West Bank has been transformed by the rapid growth of Jewish settlements over the past two years, with strident settlers pushing to impose Israeli sovereignty on the area.

2024-12-03,Space traffic on the brink: Global call for cooperation as Earth’s orbit crowds,https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/03/space-traffic-on-the-brink-global-call-for-cooperation-as-earths-orbit-crowds/158662,"BENGALURU, Dec 3 — The rapid increase in satellites and space junk will make low Earth orbit unusable unless companies and countries cooperate and share the data needed to manage that most accessible region of space, experts and industry insiders said. A United Nations panel on space traffic coordination in late October determined that urgent action was necessary and called for a comprehensive shared database of orbital objects as well as an international framework to track and manage them. More than 14,000 satellites including some 3,500 inactive surround the globe in low Earth orbit, showed data from US-based Slingshot Aerospace. Alongside those are about 120 million pieces of debris from launches, collisions and wear-and-tear of which only a few thousand are large enough to track. “There’s no time to lose on space traffic coordination. With so many objects being launched into space, we have to do everything we can to ensure space safety, and that means facilitating the sharing of information between operators, be they public or private, in order to avoid collisions,” said panel co-chair Aarti Holla-Maini, director of the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs. Low Earth orbit must remain safe to prevent costly disruption to the technology behind global communication, navigation and scientific exploration, she said. Yet there is no centralised system that all space-faring nations can leverage and even persuading them to use such a system has many obstacles. Whereas some countries are willing to share data, others fear compromising security, particularly as satellites are often dual-use and include defence purposes. Moreover, enterprises are keen to guard commercial secrets. In the meantime, the mess multiplies. A Chinese rocket stage exploded in August, adding thousands of fragments of debris to low Earth orbit. In June, a defunct Russian satellite exploded, scattering thousands of shards which forced astronauts on the International Space Station to take shelter for an hour.   Low Earth orbit is the region most congested with human-made objects as it offers a balance between cost and proximity, making it a prime target for the rapidly growing commercial space sector. It has also seen a 17 per cent rise in close approaches per satellite over the past year, Slingshot data showed. Projections point to tens of thousands more satellites entering orbit in the coming years. The potential financial risk of collisions is likely to be US$556 million over five years, based on a modelled scenario with a 3.13 per cent annual collision probability and US$111 million in yearly damages, said Montreal-based NorthStar Earth & Space. “We are at a critical point with respect to putting regulations and structure in space to monitor and manage the growing congestion. With Starlink launching thousands of satellites per year, China and others preparing to follow, we will soon push the bearing capacity of prime orbits,” said NorthStar CEO Stewart Bain. Risky business Low Earth orbit is densely packed, with bands such as the one for satellite internet service Starlink from commercial space company SpaceX — at an altitude of 540–570km. As of November 27, Starlink had 6,764 satellites in orbit, Jonathan’s Space Report showed. SpaceX data showed Starlink satellites performed nearly 50,000 collision-avoidance manoeuvres in the first half of 2024, about double the previous six months. SpaceX did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The European Space Agency, which has fewer spacecraft than SpaceX, said in 2021 its manoeuvres have increased to three or four times per craft versus a historical average of one. The 800–900km band contains fewer satellites but has 3,114 objects — including operational and non-operational payloads, rocket bodies and fragments — which make up 20 per cent of the total mass of objects in low Earth orbit, posing significant collision risk, LeoLabs data showed. Expired satellites add to the clutter as they stay in orbit until they fall into — and burn up in — Earth’s atmosphere years later or are flown to a “graveyard orbit” some 36,000km away. Russia drew global criticism in November 2021 when it test fired a missile at a defunct satellite in orbit, creating thousands of fragments of debris. Russia invaded Ukraine three months after the test. “The potential for conflicts between states has been on a steep rise in the recent past. If these extend to space it could complicate the outer space environment. We urgently need common global rules for coordination,” said Anirudh Sharma, CEO of Bengaluru-based Digantara, which specialises in space situational awareness.   Final frontier The UN’s Holla-Maini, whose office serves as secretariat for the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, said the October panel aimed to bring together public- and private-sector experts to outline steps needed to start work on coordination. It will present its findings at a committee meeting next year. Global cooperation is essential to developing enforceable rules akin to those used by the International Civil Aviation Organization for air traffic, industry experts told Reuters. Such effort would involve the use of existing tools, such as databases, telescopes, radars and other sensors to track objects while improving coverage, early detection and data precision. Yet geopolitical tension and reluctance to share data with nations deemed unfriendly as well as commercial concerns over protecting proprietary information and competitive advantages remain significant barriers. That leaves operators of orbital equipment relying on informal or semi-formal methods of avoiding collisions, such as drawing on data from the US Space Force or groups like the Space Data Association. However, this can involve issues such as accountability and inconsistent data standards. “The top challenges are speed — as consensus-building takes time — and trust,” Holla-Maini said. “Some countries simply can’t communicate with others, but the UN can facilitate this process. Speed is our biggest enemy, but there’s no alternative. It must be done.” — Reuters  "
2024-12-03,French far right party likely to back no-confidence motion against government,https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/02/french-far-right-party-likely-to-back-no-confidence-motion-against-government/158697,"PARIS, Dec 2 — France’s far-right National Rally (RN) party will likely back a no-confidence motion against the government in the coming days unless there is a “last minute miracle,” RN president Jordan Bardella said today. RN lawmaker Marine Le Pen has given Prime Minister Michel Barnier until today to yield to the party’s budget demands or face the possibility of RN backing a no-confidence motion against his government, which would lead to its collapse. “The RN will trigger the no-confidence vote mechanism unless there is a last-minute miracle if (PM) Michel Barnier revises his copy,” Bardella told RTL radio. Barnier dropped a planned electricity tax increase last week, but the RN also wants him to raise pensions in line with inflation, whereas he had aimed to increase some of them less than inflation to save money. The RN is calling for planned cuts to medication reimbursements to be scrapped and is unhappy the government may raise the tax on gas. It also wants a reduction in France’s contribution to the European Union’s budget. The standoff in the government could come to a head as early as today if Barnier has to use aggressive constitutional powers to force a social security financing bill through, which would inevitably trigger a no-confidence motion from the left. French government spokesperson Maud Bregeon told CNews television the government remained “open to dialogue” and that it was in the interests of the country that France had a budget and did not fall into financial and economic chaos. “I am very worried about what would happen in coming days and months...... who will come to France to set up a business or a plant amid such uncertainty?” she asked. France is facing a difficult financial and economic situation due to the risk its budget may be blocked in parliament, Pierre Moscovici, head of France’s public audit office, said on Monday. “Our financial situation today is dangerous,” Moscovici told France 2 television. — Reuters  "
2024-12-03,Philippine groups to seek impeachment of Vice President Duterte,https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/02/philippine-groups-to-seek-impeachment-of-vice-president-duterte/158683,"MANILA, Dec 2 — An alliance of civil society groups in the Philippines will today file an impeachment complaint against Vice President Sara Duterte, according to parliamentary group Akbayan partylist, which said its lawmaker would endorse it. Duterte, the daughter of firebrand former President Rodrigo Duterte, has been embroiled in a bitter row with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr and is the subject of a house enquiry into her spending. She denies wrongdoing. Akbayan in a statement said the “historic impeachment complaint” would be submitted to the lower house by civil society organizations, religious leaders, sectoral representatives and families of victims of her father’s bloody war on drugs, under which thousands were killed. It did not elaborate on what the grounds for impeachment were. The vice president could not immediately be reached for comment. The bid is the latest twist in a high-profile row being played out publicly between three of the Philippines highest office-holders following the collapse of a powerful alliance between their families that led to Marcos’ landslide win in the 2022 election. Sara Duterte recently said she had contracted someone to kill Marcos, his wife and house speaker Martin Romualdez - the president’s cousin - if she herself were to be killed. She later said the remarks had been taken out of context. Marcos on Friday said any impeachment complaint against his estranged vice president would only distract Congress and not help people, in remarks that drew criticism from some lawmakers. — Reuters "

2024-12-03,What else can Elon Musk try to claw back the RM250b pay deal he wants from Tesla?,https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2024/12/03/what-else-can-elon-musk-try-to-claw-back-the-rm250b-pay-deal-he-wants-from-tesla/158738,"WILMINGTON, Dec 3 — Tesla cannot give Elon Musk a US$56 billion (RM250 billion) compensation package despite a vote in support of the CEO’s pay deal by the company’s shareholders, a Delaware judge ruled on Monday. Below is a look at what could come next for Tesla and its billionaire founder, who is still seeking a huge payday from the company: What does Musk want? Musk told a special committee of the Tesla board soon after a judge voided his compensation in January that he wanted a similar-sized replacement package, according to a securities filing. In addition, earlier this year he said on his social media platform X that he wanted a larger stake in Tesla or he might develop some products outside the company. Musk’s other companies include rocket venture SpaceX and Neuralink, which develops brain implants. Tesla could appeal the ruling Musk and Tesla’s board could appeal and try to reverse the ruling at the Delaware Supreme Court, a process that typically takes around a year. The case, which involved the largest-ever pay deal at a US public company, raises issues that have rarely been addressed by Delaware judges, adding uncertainty to an appeal. For example, the trial court judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, found that Musk controlled the compensation negotiations, even though he owned only about 22 per cent of Tesla’s stock. In addition, Tesla has acknowledged that the June vote by shareholders to ratify Musk’s pay was a “novel” legal tactic and has said it was unclear how it would be treated under Delaware law. Tesla could devise a new plan Tesla’s board could craft a new pay package, although that could be very expensive. The original plan, agreed to by Musk and the company in 2018, awarded him stock options if the company hit very aggressive performance and financial targets. The stock options allowed Musk to buy Tesla stock priced at the 2018 level. The company exceeded the targets, and Tesla’s stock has risen 10-fold since then, making the options incredibly valuable. Tesla booked a cost of US$2.6 billion when the 2018 plan went into effect. The company has said that a replacement plan for the same cost today would likely have to be less than 10 per cent of the size of the 2018 plan. Could Tesla just restore the old plan? Tesla could offer Musk the same 304 million stock options with the same US$23.34 exercise price used in the 2018 plan. If shareholders wanted to challenge that, they would have to sue in Texas, where the company reincorporated this year, rather than the Court of Chancery in Delaware. But the company cannot escape accounting and tax implications. Tesla said putting the old plan back in place would require the company to take a US$25 billion charge, according to securities filings. In addition, because the stock options would be incredibly valuable from the moment they are issued, they would be treated unfavourably for tax purposes as income. Musk could be taxed at the highest rate and pay a 20 per cent penalty, meaning authorities could tax his new plan at 57 per cent, according to an analysis by Schuyler Moore of Greenberg Glusker Fields Claman & Machtinger. Musk could try to settle the lawsuit Musk could try to settle the lawsuit, which was brought by a Tesla shareholder, and accept a smaller portion of his pay package. However, that would contradict his track record of taking cases to trial rather than striking deals, even in the face of huge potential liability. It is unclear how McCormick would view a settlement at this stage in the litigation. — Reuters"
2024-12-03,Do not pass go: Elon Musk loses bid to restore US$56b Tesla pay package,https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2024/12/03/do-not-pass-go-elon-musk-loses-bid-to-restore-us56b-tesla-pay-package/158719,"WILMINGTON (Delaware), Dec 3 — A Delaware judge ruled yesterday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a US$56 billion (RM250 billion) compensation package despite shareholders of the electric vehicle company voting to reinstate it. The ruling by the judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, follows her January decision that called the pay package excessive and rescinded it, surprising investors, and cast uncertainty over Musk’s future at the world’s most valuable carmaker. Musk did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company’s driving force who is responsible for many of its advances and reinstate his compensation. McCormick said Tesla’s board was not entitled to hit “reset” to restore Musk’s pay package. “Were the court to condone the practice of allowing defeated parties to create new facts for the purpose of revising judgments, lawsuits would become interminable,” she said in her 101-page opinion. She also said Tesla made multiple material misstatements in its proxy statement regarding the vote and could not claim the vote was a “cure-all” to justify restoring Musk’s pay. “Taken together,” the problems with Tesla’s arguments “pack a powerful punch,” she wrote. Tesla shares fell 1.4 per cent in after-hours trade, after the ruling. McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the case US$345 million, well short of the US$6 billion they initially requested. She said the fee could be paid in cash or Tesla stock. “We are pleased with Chancellor McCormick’s ruling, which declined Tesla’s invitation to inject continued uncertainty into Court proceedings,” said a statement from Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, one of the three law firms for the plaintiff. The law firm also said it looked forward to defending the court’s opinion if Musk and Tesla appealed. Musk and Tesla can appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court as soon as McCormick enters a final order, which could come as soon as this week. The appeal could take a year to play out. After the January ruling, Tesla shareholders flooded the court with thousands of letters arguing that rescinding Musk’s pay increased the possibility he would leave Tesla or develop some products like artificial intelligence at ventures other than Tesla. Attorneys for shareholder Richard Tornetta, who sued in 2018 to challenge Musk’s compensation package, had argued that Delaware law does not permit a company to use a ratification vote to essentially overturn the ruling from a trial. McCormick in January found that Musk improperly controlled the 2018 board process to negotiate the pay package. The board had said that Musk deserved the package because he hit all the ambitious targets on market value, revenue and profitability. But the judge criticized Tesla’s board as “beholden” to Musk, saying the compensation plan was proposed by a board whose members had conflicts of interest due to close personal and financial ties to him. After the January ruling, Musk criticised the judge on his social media platform X and encouraged other companies to follow the lead of Tesla and reincorporate in Texas from Delaware, although it is unclear if any companies did so. The judge in her January ruling called the pay package the “biggest compensation plan ever - an unfathomable sum.” It was 33 times larger than the next biggest executive compensation package, which was Musk’s 2012 pay plan. As of yesterday, the pay package was worth US$101.4 billion, according to Equilar, a compensation consulting firm. Musk’s 2018 pay package gave him stock grants worth around 1 per cent of Tesla’s equity each time the company achieved one of 12 tranches of escalating operational and financial goals. Musk did not receive any guaranteed salary. Tornetta argued that shareholders were not told how easily the goals would be achieved when they voted on the package. — Reuters  "
2024-12-03,Intel CEO Gelsinger leaves amid turnaround troubles,https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2024/12/03/intel-ceo-gelsinger-leaves-amid-turnaround-troubles/158720,"NEW YORK, Dec 3 — Intel announced yesterday that CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired effective December 1, as the once dominant chip-making giant company struggles to catch up with rivals. The abrupt departure comes after the company in August vowed to cut more than 15,000 jobs in a draconian cost-reduction plan and paused or delayed construction on several chipmaking facilities. The company named CFO David Zinsner and newly appointed Intel Products CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim co-chief executives while it searches for a permanent successor. Gelsinger, who began his career at Intel in 1979 and served as its first chief technology officer, returned to the company as CEO in 2021 during a critical period for the company. Intel is one of Silicon Valley’s most iconic companies, but its fortunes have been eclipsed by Asian powerhouses TSMC and Samsung which dominate the made-to-order semiconductor business. The company was also caught by surprise with the emergence of Nvidia, a graphics chip maker, as the world’s preeminent AI chip maker. Under Gelsinger’s leadership, Intel invested heavily in semiconductor manufacturing and worked to revitalize its production capabilities, often by relying heavily on government subsidies. US President Joe Biden’s administration last month finalised a US$$7.9 billion (RM35.3 billion) award to Intel as part of his effort of bringing semiconductor production to US shores. But in Europe, Intel last month said it was delaying its plans to build two mega chip-making factories in Germany and Poland as the company faces lower demand than anticipated. Intel also said it would pull back on its projects in Malaysia. “Leading Intel has been the honour of my lifetime,” Gelsinger said in a statement, acknowledging the “challenging year” as the company adapted to market conditions. Zinsner joined Intel in 2022 from Micron Technology, while Holthaus is a nearly 30-year Intel veteran who previously led the company’s Client Computing Group. “We know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Board chairman Frank Yeary said in the company’s statement. In September, the Wall Street Journal reported that rival Qualcomm had made a takeover approach of embattled Intel, which has a market cap of just over US$100 billion. Intel’s share price yesterday, which has slumped by 50 per cent this year, was up by nearly three per cent on Wall Street. — AFP  "
2024-12-03,Ninja Mart’s first-ever nationwide Spend & Win campaign a commercial success,https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2024/12/03/ninja-marts-first-ever-nationwide-spend-win-campaign-a-commercial-success/158727,"KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 3 — Ninja Mart, the FMCG focused unit by Ninja Van Malaysia, recently concluded its highly successful Spend & Win campaign over the course of three months. As the touchpoint between FMCGs and an extensive network of independent urban and small rural retailers, Ninja Mart conducted this first-ever nationwide campaign to actively engage and give back to the 30,000-plus retailers from the North, Central, and Southern key regions across the country. These regions have been the platform’s firm pillar of support since its launch in 2022. In promoting nationwide and impactful inclusion, its community also encompasses the 200-plus salesmen operating in 14 hubs across the said regions, with the support of four brand sponsors for this campaign. Held between 1 April 2024 and 30 June 2024, the partnership saw brand partners Cricket, Indomie, Yoke Food Industries Sdn Bhd, and Karabao Marketing offering attractive prizes in enticing the accumulation of draw tickets by the retailers throughout the campaign period. As the Spend & Win name suggests, the campaign mechanics involved combining monthly trade marketing mechanics and cashback tier mechanics to increase the retailers’ engagement through ticket collection via the Ninja Mart Cashback app. This automatically enables participation in the Spend & Win lucky draw contest and for retailers to stand a chance of winning up to RM60,000 in prize rewards. As much as the retailers had the opportunity to be rewarded, the brand sponsors too, had the opportunity to gain greater visibility and broader market reach, and played a crucial role in driving over 30,000 retailers’ engagement that contributed towards the campaign’s success. Additionally, the partners benefited from the Sales Facing app that offered them real-time data and insights on store performance, enabling them to track sales trends, make informed decisions, and plan strategically on their investments to maximise growth. Intangible benefits derived were the close ties forged with the 200-strong sales team during their weekly route visit. In terms of Ninja Mart’s key milestones, it successfully engaged over 8,000 retailers, attracted over 300,000 ticket entries, and boarded 6,000 new app users on its Ninja Mart app under its nationwide digitalisation drive especially among the rural retailers. “This campaign is hugely significant as it is about recognising top performing stores as much as it was about fostering stronger relationships between the local teams, retailers, and our brand partners, and ultimately giving back and recognising those who have been a key part of our journey,” says Country Head of Ninja Van, Lin Zheng. “We achieved our objectives and more in the end; besides thanking our brand partners for their generous sponsorship, we are happy that they made some important strides and reaped positive outcomes via this campaign,” Head of Ninja Mart, Malaysia & Vice President of Operations at Ninja Van, Matthew Sequerah Lee. To further drive engagement and boost top-of-mind awareness, various pronged activities were launched alongside creative offline marketing efforts to complement the Spend & Win programme. For the top loyalty stores, the top 200 with the top 10% multi category spent will be enrolled into Ninja Mart’s Komuniti Rewards loyalty programme, while the Salesman Rewards Programme offered additional rewards for the sales force to optimise the campaign uptake. During the Ramadan month of the campaign’s tenure, retailers with purchases of any multi-category products received a Ramadan goodie bag featuring products from the four sponsors. Following the campaign, the winners were announced on livestream via Youtube and the Ninja Mart app in August. The prize-giving ceremony also made history for the first time as Ninja Mart hosted three separate physical events in key regions to celebrate the campaign’s success. The first two prize-giving ceremonies took place on 11 September in Batu Pahat and 12 September in Segamat, Johor while the third ceremony was held on 19 September in Machang, Kelantan. Over 30 attractive prizes were presented, including a Perodua Bezza G (1.0) as the grand prize, a Yamaha Y15ZR motorcycle as a second prize, a Samsung Qled 65-inch 4K television as the third prize, and more. The campaign also entailed monthly-tiered cashback rewards, brand and product level benefits and promotions. Since its founding in 2022, Ninja Mart has supported over 30,000 outlets nationwide, powered by Ninja Van’s logistics technology. The platform offers fulfilment and last-mile delivery services to urban retailers and provides a full end-to-end distribution solution - including van sales and cash handling rural zones - to suburban and rural outlets.

At 8.03am, the ringgit eased to 4.4595/4680 against the US dollar compared with yesterday’s close of 4.4570/4625. Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Dr Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said the US dollar was boosted by concerns over the French politics wherein there was a motion of no-confidence vote over disagreement on the country’s budget. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve’s (Fed) governor Christopher Waller suggested he would opt for rate cuts in the December meeting, raising the odds for more monetary easing. “As such, ringgit could remain range bound against the US dollar as market sentiments are still wary on the Fed’s future outlook in 2025 as threats over higher tariff could raise the inflation rate next year. That could shape the pace of monetary easing,” he told Bernama. The ringgit traded mostly higher against a basket of major currencies. It advanced against the British pound to 5.6426/6534 from 5.6613/6683 yesterday, edged up against the euro to 4.6807/6896 from 4.6856/6914 but fell vis-a-vis the Japanese yen to 2.9784/9842 from 2.9648/9687 yesterday. The local note also traded mostly lower against Asean currencies. It was lower against the Singapore dollar at 3.3136/3202 from yesterday’s close of 3.3113/3156 and eased against the Philippine peso to 7.60/7.62 from 7.59/7.61 The local unit went up against the Thai baht to 12.9134/9462 from 12.9196/9423 yesterday and eased against the Indonesian rupiah at 280.3/281.0 from 280.1/280.6 previously. — Bernama "
2024-12-03,"US blocks China's chip ambitions with new tariffs on toolmakers, Malaysia, Singapore caught in crosshairs",https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2024/12/02/us-blocks-chinas-chip-ambitions-with-new-tariffs-on-chip-toolmakers-including-malaysia-and-singapore/158664,"WASHINGTON, Dec 2 — The US will launch its third crackdown in three years on China’s semiconductor industry today, restricting exports to 140 companies including chip equipment maker Naura Technology Group, among other moves, according to two people familiar with the matter. The effort to hobble Beijing’s chipmaking ambitions will also hit Chinese chip toolmakers Piotech and SiCarrier Technology with new export restrictions as part of the package, which also takes aim at shipments of advanced memory chips and more chipmaking tools to China. The move marks one of the Biden Administration’s last large-scale effort to stymy China’s ability to access and produce chips that can help advance artificial intelligence for military applications or otherwise threaten US national security. It comes just weeks before the swearing in of Republican former president Donald Trump, who is expected to keep in place many of Biden’s tough-on-China measures. The package includes curbs on China-bound shipments of high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are critical for high-end applications like AI training; new curbs on 24 additional chipmaking tools and three software tools; and new export restrictions on chipmaking equipment manufactured in countries including Singapore and Malaysia. The tool controls will likely hurt Lam Research, KLA and Applied Materials, as well as non-US companies like Dutch equipment maker ASM International . Among Chinese companies facing new restrictions are nearly two dozen semiconductor companies, two investment companies and over 100 chipmaking tool makers, the sources said. US lawmakers say some of the companies, including Swaysure Technology Co, Qingdao SiEn, and Shenzhen Pensun Technology Co, work with China’s Huawei Technologies, the telecommunications equipment leader once hobbled by US sanctions and now at the center of China’s advanced chip production and development. They will be added to the entity list, which bars US suppliers from shipping to them without first receiving a special license. China has stepped up its drive to become self-sufficient in the semiconductor sector in recent years, as the US and other countries have restricted exports of the advanced chips and the tools to make them. However, it remains years behind chip industry leaders like Nvidia in AI chips and chip equipment maker ASML in the Netherlands. The US also is poised to place additional restrictions on Semiconductor Manufacturing International, China’s largest contract chip manufacturer, which was placed on the Entity List in 2020 but with a policy that allowed billions of dollars worth of licenses to ship goods to it to be granted. For the first time, the US will add two companies that make investments in chips to the entity list. Chinese private equity firm Wise Road Capital and tech firm Wingtech Technology Co will be added. Companies seeking licenses to ship to firms on the Entity List generally get denied. Dutch and Japanese exempted An aspect of the new package that addresses the foreign direct product rule could hurt some US allies by limiting what their companies can ship to China. The new rule will expand US powers to curb exports of chipmaking equipment by US, Japanese, and Dutch manufacturers made in other parts of the world to certain chip plants in China. Equipment made in Malaysia, Singapore, Israel, Taiwan and South Korea is subject to the rule while the Netherlands and Japan will be exempt. The expanded foreign direct product rule will apply to 16 companies on the entity list that are seen as the most important to China’s most advanced chipmaking ambitions. The rule will also lower to zero the amount of US content that determines when certain foreign items are subject to US control. That will allow the US to regulate any item shipped to China from overseas if it contains any US chips. The new rules are being released after lengthy discussions with Japan and the Netherlands, which, along with the US, dominate the production of advanced chipmaking equipment. The US plans to exempt countries that put in place similar controls, the people said. Another rule in the package restricts memory used in AI chips that correspond with what is known as “HBM 2” and higher, technology made by South Korea’s Samsung and SK Hynix and US-based Micron. Industry sources only expect Samsung Electronics to be impacted. The latest rules are the third major package of chip-related export restrictions on China implemented under the Biden administration. In October 2022, the US published a sweeping set of controls to curb the sale and manufacture of certain high-end chips which were considered to be the biggest shift in US tech policy toward China since the 1990s. — Reuters  "
2024-12-03,"Bursa Malaysia closes slightly higher, plantation gains trimmed by profit-taking",https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2024/12/02/bursa-malaysia-closes-slightly-higher-plantation-gains-trimmed-by-profit-taking/158703," KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 2 — Bursa Malaysia closed marginally higher today as gains in plantation counters were trimmed by profit-taking activities in selected index-linked financial services heavyweights. At 5pm, the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBM KLCI) was 1.19 points, or 0.075 per cent, higher at 1,595.48 from Friday’s close of 1,594.29. The index opened 2.55 points higher at 1,596.84 and moved between 1,593.37 and 1,603.94 today. On the broader market, decliners led gainers 549 to 497 while 490 counters were unchanged, 879 untraded and 15 suspended. Turnover was reduced to 2.83 billion units valued at RM2.37 billion versus 3.43 billion units valued at RM3.19 billion on Friday. Rakuten Trade Sdn Bhd equity research vice-president Thong Pak Leng said the FBM KLCI traded within a narrow range as investors remained cautious due to foreign selling, which prevented the benchmark index from sustaining the 1,600 mark despite several attempts. On the regional front, markets surged, led by China and Hong Kong, which recorded gains as China’s November manufacturing data exceeded expectations, supported by recent aggressive stimulus measures. Thong said that looking ahead, the US is set to release the manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) later today and the S&P Global Composite PMI on Wednesday. “Given the unexpected shift in local market sentiments, we recommend maintaining caution amid rising volatility. “Investors should consider accumulating blue-chip stocks with strong fundamentals, particularly those that have experienced notable declines, as they are now trading at attractive valuations,” he told Bernama. As such, Rakuten Trade anticipates the FBM KLCI to remain in its sideways pattern, trading within the 1,590–1,610 range for the week. Mohd Sedek Jantan, head of investment research at UOB Kay Hian Wealth Advisors, credited today’s market stability to Wall Street’s strong performance last Friday, and with gains primarily driven by solid momentum in aluminium producers, bolstered by robust earnings results. “As we move into December, we anticipate a potential rebound in the index following its 0.60 per cent decline in November. “Historical data from 2003 to 2023 shows that the FBM KLCI had delivered positive returns in December on 16 occasions, with only five instances of negative performance,” he said.

Among the active stocks, Velesto Energy and Aimflex were both half-a-sen lower at 15.5 sen, while Sapura Energy, Capital A and Saudigold were flat at four sen, RM1 and two sen respectively.

2024-12-03,"Malaysia’s air traffic soars to 80.3 million in first 10 months of 2024, set to meet Mavcom’s full-year forecast",https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2024/12/02/malaysias-air-traffic-soars-to-803-million-in-first-10-months-of-2024-set-to-meet-mavcoms-full-year-forecast/158680,"KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 2 — Malaysia’s air passenger traffic for the first 10 months of the year reached 80.3 million, putting the country on track to meet the Malaysian Aviation Commission’s (Mavcom) full-year forecast of 95.4 million to 97.6 million passengers. Mavcom attributed the growth to a steady recovery in domestic and international travel, building on the strong performance recorded in September 2024 with October 2024 seeing eight million passengers, marking a 13.0 per cent year-on-year (y-o-y) increase. However, the figure marked a 2.7 per cent month-on-month (m-o-m) decline compared to September’s 8.2 million passengers, it said in a statement today. “October’s traffic reached 89.7 per cent of the level recorded in October 2019, reflecting the continued recovery in international and domestic travel following the pandemic. “International air traffic was the key growth driver in October 2024, with 4.2 million passengers recorded, representing a robust 20.5 per cent y-o-y increase, equivalent to 95.3 per cent of the October 2019 level,” it shared. Mavcom noted that non-Asean international traffic performed particularly well with a 25.6 per cent y-o-y increase, while Asean routes grew by 15.8 per cent y-o-y. Domestically, October 2024 saw 3.8 million passengers, reflecting a 5.9 per cent y-o-y increase but a 5.1 per cent m-o-m decline, it said. Mavcom noted that in September 2024, international non-Asean travel surpassed pre-pandemic levels for the first time, achieving a recovery rate of 101 per cent. “The robust growth recorded in September and October was driven by increased seat capacity, new routes introductions, and visa exemptions for Chinese and Indian travellers. These measures strengthened Malaysia’s position as a preferred destination for both leisure and business travellers,” it shared. Mavcom executive chairman Datuk Seri Saripuddin Kasim said the aviation sector’s recovery momentum is evident in the strong y-o-y growth reported for October, building on the positive momentum achieved in September. “The increasing confidence in Malaysia as a global travel destination, coupled with initiatives such as visa exemptions for tourists from China and India, along with the introduction of new international routes, has been instrumental in driving growth, particularly in the non-Asean market,” he said. Visa exemptions for Chinese and Indian tourists will remain in effect until 2025, further supporting the sector’s recovery and growth. — Bernama  "

The new United manager, who has won two and drawn one of his three games in charge, has spoken of his appreciation at his warm welcome since replacing the sacked Erik ten Hag. But the former Sporting Lisbon boss, speaking ahead of Wednesday’s match against Arsenal, said the vocal support for him, to the tune of “Give it Up” by KC and the Sunshine Band, made him feel uneasy. “I don’t like my chant,” Amorim said on Monday. “I don’t like it. I feel a little bit... not embarrassed, but because I’m the coach they have to chant for the players and for the club. “It’s not a good thing for me. I understand and I really appreciate the connection with the supporters, but I want them to support the team and the players because they are on the pitch, I’m outside the pitch. “But I am really honoured about that and I feel a connection with the supporters, but we know we need results to maintain that.” New Era begins#manchesterunited#mufc#mufcvids#fyp#manutd#viral#mufcaway#football#fans#premierleague Amorim said he expects “special talent” Leny Yoro to be in the United squad for the first time against Arsenal, who are second in the Premier League. The 19-year-old French defender was signed in July in a deal worth an initial 62 million euros (RM291 million, £51 million) but sustained a metatarsal injury in pre-season and required surgery. “Maybe Leny Yoro is going to be in the squad,” Amorim said. “I felt that he is in a good moment now, his fitness is better, so I think he’s going to be in the squad. “I think he’s a special talent. We have to be careful in this first moment because we didn’t have too many trainings together, so he is training not alone but with a small group of players. “He’s really fast, he’s a modern defender, and that is good when you want to press high and you leave a lot of strikers, especially in this league, one against one. I think he can manage that. He is very good with the ball, so I am very excited.” United, who have a poor recent record at the Emirates, are ninth in the Premier League, four points off the top four. — AFP"

Arne Slot’s team have 18 wins in their 20 matches in all competitions and the captain believes the mentality within the squad is a crucial factor, just months after the departure of Jurgen Klopp. Table-topping Liverpool beat Manchester City 2-0 on Sunday to move 11 points clear of the champions in the Premier League and they are nine points ahead of their nearest challengers, Arsenal and Chelsea. “I think it was always going to be difficult to replace Jurgen for everything he did for us, as players and for the club, but he (Slot) has come in, done it his own way,” said Van Dijk. “Together with the staff he started working and making sure we have the quality to improve and win games. “But he makes sure we keep working, are not satisfied, focus on what is ahead of us next and keep improving.” The Dutch international said former Feyenoord boss Slot had hit the ground running. “He has come in and done very well so far and he has, in my opinion, inherited a very good squad not only as football players but as human beings—guys who will go to war for each other,” said the defender. “(He has done) a lot of tactical work but at the end of the day it is about how much we want it as players.” Liverpool have won the English top flight just once since 1990 — in 2020 — and Van Dijk urged caution. “I want to be there at the end of the season, that’s the aim, and in order to be there at the end of the season we have to focus on what’s ahead of us and not thinking about what’s there in January or February,” he said. “Now it’s Newcastle (on Wednesday) and (it’s about) doing everything in my power and our power to be ready for a big one there as well.” — AFP  "

The Dutchman had four games in caretaker charge at Old Trafford — two of them against Leicester — following Erik ten Hag’s sacking at the end of October, but left the club when Ruben Amorim arrived last month. Van Nistelrooy, speaking at his first press conference since replacing the sacked Steve Cooper at the King Power, said offers had poured in. “What happened after the games and the amount of interest, the options that all of a sudden were there for me and the options that came along, I was a little bit astonished,” he said on Monday. “It was four games and I managed a full season at PSV (Eindhoven), was able to win the cup and the charity shield. I have been in coaching, in the (under) 19s and the national team (with the Netherlands) and it never got this reaction from the football world. “It provoked these reactions and I was only happy with that — and to get in conversations with different parties and be able to make a decision which felt really good for me and I am happy to be here.” He said he had enjoyed his “intense” spell in the Old Trafford hot seat and had helped “steady the ship”. “I really enjoyed it, being responsible, creating a connection with the team, with the supporters and turning the momentum for the club for a little bit,” he added. “That is our job and that felt great to do and it just got better now I am in this position to do it again.” Van Nistelrooy, whose first game in charge of Leicester is against West Ham on Tuesday, takes over a side just a point above the relegation zone after 13 games. Caretaker boss Ben Dawson oversaw Saturday’s 4-1 loss at Brentford, the team’s third straight defeat. Van Nistelrooy, a former striker for United and Real Madrid, said he was proud to have been given the opportunity to manage the former Premier League champions, where “expectations are clear”. “It is something we face, that challenge to maintain and play in the Premier League and that is the big target for everybody to achieve that,” he said. The 48-year-old added: “In two days it’s difficult to make a lot of changes, but we have started to make changes in the style of play, training sessions, structure, little by little starting to build a foundation of a highly motivated team who can compete in this league.” — AFP"

Nicol is only the third member of the PSA Hall of Fame, which was launched earlier this year to recognise the achievements of the sport’s most influential figures, both past and present. In a post on her Instagram, she dedicated the achievement to her parents, coaches and Malaysia for being her ultimate support throughout her career. “Inducted in the Hall of Fame, today (yesterday) is a very meaningful day.

Nicol, who turned professional in 2000, was voted as the greatest female squash player of all time in a PSA poll in 2018, besides being ranked world number one first for 109 consecutive months. Meanwhile, in the same post she said her biggest mission now is all about her foundation, Nicol David Organisation, to support children, families and communities in Malaysia. “Hope that one day that these efforts will be also recognised in Malaysia and the world,” she said. — Bernama  "

Goals from Cody Gakpo and Mohamed Salah gave leaders Liverpool a 2-0 win at Anfield which left City 11 points behind Arne Slot’s side in fifth place. City, who lost four league games in a row for the first time since 2008, are winless in their last seven matches in all competitions, a run that includes six defeats and a 3-3 draw at home against Feyenoord in the Champions League. They have conceded 19 goals during the winless streak, shipping four in matches against Tottenham Hotspur and Sporting. Prior to the slump they had conceded 11 in 14 games. “I will not talk about the little details but focus on the bigger picture,” said Dias, who was at fault in the lead up to Liverpool’s second. “That is, even though it was a difficult moment I did see a lot of character and I did see the fans behind us and that is the only way we are going to go through it.” City, who have won six of the last seven Premier League titles, have been hit hard by injuries to key players such as Rodri, Mateo Kovacic and John Stones but manager Pep Guardiola has been able to guide the side through injury crises in previous seasons. “This is just part of our legacy. We have won so much and still we are where we are and this happens,” Dias added. “We have been able to be versatile, adapt and keep on moving forward and thinking one game at a time...

Guardiola was met with chants of “you’re getting sacked in the morning” from the home support after City suffered a sixth defeat in seven games to fall 11 points behind the Reds at the top of the table. The 53-year-old recently extended his contract at the Etihad to 2027 but has said he will not overstay his welcome if results do not improve. Guardiola, though, could not resist hitting back by showing six fingers, one for each of his title triumphs. Two of those came by denying Liverpool by a single point in 2018/19 and 2021/22. “All the stadiums want to sack me, it started at Brighton (in City’s 2-1 defeat on November 9),” said Guardiola. “Maybe they are right with the results we’ve been having.” Defeat continued Guardiola’s miserable record at Anfield. City have lost in six of their 10 visits under the Catalan, with their only win coming behind closed doors due to the coronavirus pandemic in 2021. “I didn’t expect that at Anfield.
