2024-12-04,S.Korean president abandons martial law attempt,https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/04/skorean-president-abandons-martial-law-attempt/158806,"SEOUL, Dec 4 — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol abandoned a short-lived attempt at martial law today, reversing course after lawmakers defied security forces to vote against his declaration and thousands of protesters took to the streets. Yoon’s shock bid to impose South Korea’s first martial law in over four decades plunged the country into its deepest turmoil in its modern democratic history and caught even South Korea’s closest allies around the world off guard. It also left the future of Yoon — a conservative politician and former star public prosecutor who was elected president in 2022 — in jeopardy. South Korea’s main opposition party — whose lawmakers jumped fences and tussled with security forces so they could vote to overturn the law — demanded Yoon to step down immediately over the attempted “insurrection”. The nation’s largest umbrella labour union also called an “indefinite general strike” until Yoon resigned. And the leader of Yoon’s own ruling party even described the attempt as “tragic” while calling for those involved to be held accountable. Yoon backed down after lawmakers voted to oppose the declaration, which he made late on Tuesday night citing the threat of North Korea and “anti-state forces”. “Just a moment ago, there was a demand from the National Assembly to lift the state of emergency, and we have withdrawn the military that was deployed for martial law operations,” Yoon said in a televised address around 4:30 am (5.30pm Malaysian time). “We will accept the National Assembly’s request and lift the martial law through the Cabinet meeting.” Yonhap news agency then reported that Yoon’s cabinet had approved the motion to lift the order. The U-turn prompted jubilation among protesters outside parliament who had braved freezing temperatures to keep vigil through the night in defiance of Yoon’s martial law order. Demonstrators who had been waving South Korean flags and chanting “Arrest Yoon Sul Yeol” outside the National Assembly erupted in cheers. Lim Myeong-pan, 55, told AFP that Yoon’s decision to rescind martial law did not absolve him of wrongdoing. “Yoon’s act of imposing it in the first place without legitimate cause is a serious crime in itself,” Lim told AFP. “He has paved his own path to impeachment with this.” Defying security forces, 190 lawmakers managed to get in to the assembly in the early hours of today and unanimously voted to oppose martial law. Under the constitution, martial law must be lifted when a majority in parliament demands it.   International concern Yoon had given a range of reasons to justify martial law—South Korea’s first in more than 40 years. “To safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea’s communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people’s freedom and happiness, I hereby declare emergency martial law,” Yoon said in a televised address. Yoon did not give details of the North’s threats, but the South remains technically at war with nuclear-armed Pyongyang. “Our National Assembly has become a haven for criminals, a den of legislative dictatorship that seeks to paralyse the judicial and administrative systems and overturn our liberal democratic order,” Yoon said. The president labelled the main opposition Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the 300-member parliament, “anti-state forces intent on overthrowing the regime”. Yoon and his People Power Party are also bitterly at odds with the opposition over next year’s budget. Opposition MPs last week approved a significantly downsized budget plan through a parliamentary committee. The imposition of emergency martial law came after Yoon’s approval rating dropped to 19 percent in the latest Gallup poll last week, with many expressing dissatisfaction over his handling of the economy and controversies involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee. Concern, relief Democratic South Korea is a major ally for the United States in Asia, but Washington said it was not given advance notice of Yoon’s plan to impose martial law. The United States initially voiced “grave concern” at the declaration, then relief. “We are relieved President Yoon has reversed course on his concerning declaration of martial law and respected the ROK National Assembly’s vote to end it,” a National Security Council spokesperson said in a statement, using the acronym for South Korea’s official name. China, a key ally of North Korea, had urged its nationals in the South to stay calm and exercise caution, while Britain said it was “closely monitoring developments”. Vladimir Tikhonov, professor of Korea studies at the University of Oslo, said Yoon’s move to impose martial law was “an attempt to wind the history back”. “I don’t think South Korea’s civil society can recognise Yoon as a legitimate president any longer,” he told AFP. — AFP "

The charges are believed related to the investment losses of government-linked investment companies Khazanah Nasional Berhad (Khazanah) and Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB) in FashionValet, totalling RM43.9 million. Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) chief Tan Sri Azam Baki confirmed the court action against the duo, several local news outlets including Berita Harian and Harian Metro reported last night, after the couple were arrested at noon but released on bail earlier yesterday. The MACC announced the completion of its investigations into the investment loss on November 28, following its submission to government lawyers for review and consideration.

He said that although it is not an offence if they fail to comply with such announcements, it is to avoid risks to personal and public safety, especially if the vehicle has hazardous issues. “Usually, when a manufacturer finds any defect or technical issue with the vehicle, they are required to notify JPJ, and JPJ will then announce the recall. This is the standard procedure. “It is a personal risk, not an issue of guilt... if they do not respond to the JPJ recall (for inspection), they will bear the safety risks, which we do not want, that’s why the announcement comes from JPJ because owners will take it more seriously. If the company calls, they might ignore it because it’s not from the authorities,” he said. He told this to reporters after officiating the closing ceremony of the Negeri Sembilan-level MyLesen Programme 2024, which benefitted over 400 recipients, including the Orang Asli community, students, and youth. Loke further explained that previously, vehicle manufacturers usually made recall announcements, but the government now mandates that such announcements be made by JPJ. Previously, the media reported that JPJ had initiated recalls of various vehicle types for inspection due to technical issues, including problems with wheel speed sensors affecting the Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), traction control, and speedometer accuracy. Meanwhile, Loke, who is also the Member of Parliament for Seremban, said as of yesterday, over 11 million individuals had the JPJeID to access the MyJPJ App, while more than 14 million users had downloaded the app. “As of Oct 31, RM222.7 million has been recorded for transactions related to the renewal of Road Tax and Malaysian Driving Licences digitally. This shows acceptance of the digital transformation, which enhances efficiency for both users and the department,” he said. Earlier, Loke said that 2,239 individuals successfully obtained Class B2 (Motorcycle) and PSV (E-Hailing) licences in the state this year, with 591 Orang Asli obtaining Class B2 driving licences. “We are also collaborating with the Department of Orang Asli Development (JAKOA) to identify eligible Orang Asli individuals for driving licences this year, including in Negeri Sembilan. This is our focus as their awareness is still low,” he said. He added that the MyLesen programme presents an opportunity for the B40 group to improve their standard of living, as it allows individuals to work in sectors that require transportation, such as e-hailing drivers or other jobs requiring a driving licence.— Bernama  "

The couple fled Singapore in 2005 during investigations into Ng’s alleged misuse of electronic scrap from his company, Citiraya Industries, which defrauded clients of over US$51 million (RM228 million). Ng, the former CEO of Citiraya, allegedly orchestrated a scheme to divert shipments of electronic scrap meant for recycling, selling the materials as new products through syndicates in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Investigations by Singapore’s Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) revealed he misappropriated 89 tonnes of scrap and paid nearly S$2 million in bribes to employees and associates. Ng’s wife was also implicated in the operation, which came to light in December 2004 when Taiwanese authorities intercepted a chip marked for destruction. Authorities have since prosecuted 12 individuals, handing down sentences ranging from eight months to eight years. The couple evaded capture by assuming false identities, despite extensive efforts that included warrants, Interpol Red Notices, and seizure of assets totalling S$23 million, including luxury properties. The CPIB confirmed this as the largest asset seizure against an individual on record. According toThe Straits Times, Ng and Thor were apprehended in Johor Baru by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and extradited to Singapore the same day. CPIB director of investigations Vincent Lim lauded the collaboration with MACC, telling the paper: “The successful arrest... attests to the longstanding ties and close cooperation between CPIB and MACC.” “There is zero tolerance and no safe haven for those who choose to break our laws... CPIB will spare no effort to track them down wherever they may hide and bring them to face justice in Singapore.” Ng will face charges of criminal breach of trust, while Thor is charged under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes Act. Both will appear in court today."

The Federal Territories Ministry said it reviewed 12 of the RoL projects in the pre-execution stage to ensure that only the most significant initiatives proceed. “Therefore, five projects have been cancelled as they are not significant enough to achieve the objectives of the River of Life’s implementation. “However, seven other projects will proceed to achieve the initial objective of the project namely cleaning and beautifying rivers,” its minister Dr Zaliha Mustafa said in a written reply to Parliament yesterday. The RoL, launched by the federal government, aims to transform the Gombak River and the Klang River into dynamic and liveable waterfronts with high economic value. The Auditor-General’s report in July found that the RoL project that was supposed to wrap up this year, is nowhere near completion. The project has so far used up RM3.915 billion, making up 89.7 per cent of its ceiling cost."
2024-12-04,Najib: My phone call to 1MDB chairman was not to pressure 1MDB board to approve US$1b deal,https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/12/03/najib-my-phone-call-to-1mdb-chairman-was-not-to-pressure-1mdb-board-to-approve-us1b-deal/158799,"KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 3 ± Former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak today denied that he had intended in 2009 to pressure government-owned 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) into approving a US$1 billion joint venture with PetroSaudi International Limited (PSI). Testifying as the first defence witness in his 1MDB trial, Najib explained his September 26, 2009 phone conversation with 1MDB chairman Tan Sri Mohd Bakke Salleh just before the 1MDB board of directors started their meeting on the proposed US$1 billion joint venture. Najib said he had on that day received a call on his mobile phone from Low Taek Jho — a Malaysian fugitive better known as Jho Low. Among other things, Najib claimed that Low had asked if he could briefly speak with Bakke before the 1MDB board meeting starts, to share the US$1 billion deal’s context of the alleged “government to government” initiative between Malaysia and Saudi Arabia. “I agreed, and Jho Low passed the phone to Tan Sri Bakke. In our short exchange, I simply requested Tan Sri Bakke to consider PSI’s proposal, as it was a ‘Government-to-Government’ initiative that the 1MDB board of directors had been reviewing for a while. “I asked that he and the board proceed with firming up a decision, which I assumed would be after hearing Jho Low’s briefing from PSI’s perspective,” he told the High Court, adding however that he later found out that Low did not actually deliver the briefing at the 1MDB board meeting. “It is important to clarify that my purpose in this brief exchange was not to direct or pressure the board to participate in the joint venture with PSI,” he said, claiming that he had only intended to encourage Bakke to consider the proposal. “I categorically deny that my brief exchange with Tan Sri Bakke was meant to compel or even influence the board to participate in a joint venture with PSI,” he again said later. Najib said he had not asked Bakke to put his phone call on speaker for him to direct the entire 1MDB board on the US$1 billion joint venture. Najib denied ordering or directing Bakke to convince the 1MDB board to agree to the joint venture, and also denied ordering Bakke to direct the rest of the 1MDB board to do so as if it was a directive from Najib.   Asked again about Low’s request for him to speak with Bakke before the 1MDB board meeting, Najib said: “I did not give it much thought, I just simply agreed to speak with Tan Sri Bakke as Jho Low’s request seemed reasonable. My brief exchange with Tan Sri Bakke was in no way intended to influence him or the Board in their decision-making process.” Najib claimed that Bakke would have ensured that the 1MDB board meeting minutes on September 26, 2009 recorded any directive by Najib on the joint venture, if he had made such a directive to Bakke. “However, no such directive is recorded, further supporting that my brief exchange with Tan Sri Bakke did not and was not intended to influence the Board’s decision,” he said. Najib said it would have been essential for Bakke to ensure the meeting minutes recorded any such directives from Najib, to show that the 1MDB board was acting on Najib’s direct order and also to protect Bakke himself and the 1MDB board by documenting that their decision was based on Najib’s instructions. “The fact that he did not record this in the minutes indicates that, even in his mind, he did not perceive our brief exchange as a directive or order from me,” Najib claimed, also asserting that Bakke did not tell the High Court that Najib had directed him. “Assuming Tan Sri Bakke did relay the details of our brief exchange to the board, it’s worth noting that none of the board members felt that the exchange constituted a directive or order and this would suggest that they viewed their decision to resolve that 1MDB enter into the joint venture with PetroSaudi International Limited as independent and agreeable on its own merits, rather than as an instruction from me,” he claimed. Najib said Bakke who was then Felda chairman saw him from time to time, adding that Bakke could have easily raised any doubts about 1MDB to him but said the latter did not do so. Previously, Bakke had told the 1MDB trial that the 1MDB board members had agreed not to include Najib’s phone call in the September 26, 2009 meeting minutesto leave his name out of the public domain, and that this hadinsulatedthen prime minister Najib. The prosecution had previously said in this trial that it would prove that US$20 million (over RM60 million), from the US$1 billion joint venture had ended up in Najib’s personal bank account. Najib’s 1MDB trial before judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah resumes tomorrow morning.  "
2024-12-04,How to spot a loan shark: Crucial warning signs every borrower must know,https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/12/04/how-to-spot-a-loan-shark-crucial-warning-signs-every-borrower-must-know/158209,"KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 4 — Loan sharks are now trawling cyberspace, particularly social media platforms like TikTok, making it increasingly challenging for borrowers to distinguish between licensed moneylenders and illegal operators. As of October this year, Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department has recorded 777 cases linked to loan sharks. Even school students are being targeted. In a recent case, a 15-year-old boy from Selangor revealed he had racked up RM13,000 in debt to 12 loan sharks after responding to an advertisement on TikTok. So, how can you identify a loan shark? Here are some key warning signs to watch out for: Legal moneylenders must be licensed and display their licences at their business premises. Under the Moneylenders Act 1951, moneylenders are required to apply for a licence from the Registrar of Moneylenders. This licence, unless revoked earlier, is valid for two years, and moneylenders must apply for renewal at least 60 days before it expires. Unlicensed moneylenders can face fines ranging from RM250,000 to RM1 million, imprisonment for up to five years, or both. Repeat offenders may also be subject to corporal punishment in addition to the penalties mentioned. The Act also mandates that licensed moneylenders must display their original licence at their business premises at all times. Failure to do so can result in a fine of up to RM10,000, a jail term of up to six months, or both. Borrowers have the right to request to see the moneylender’s licence to ensure they are dealing with a legitimate, licensed moneylender rather than a loan shark. Borrowers must obtain a duly stamped copy of the agreement Section 16 of the Moneylenders Act requires that the moneylending agreement be signed by all parties and duly stamped before a copy is provided to the borrower. If this requirement is not met, the agreement is deemed unenforceable, and the moneylender may face a fine of up to RM10,000, imprisonment for up to 12 months, or both. This is often the most glaring omission in loan shark arrangements. Victims are typically asked to sign an agreement but are not given a copy of it. Reasonable versus excessive interest rates Loan sharks typically charge exorbitant interest rates, which can range from 10 to 20 per cent per week. However, Section 17A(1) of the Act states that the interest rate for a secured loan (one backed by collateral) cannot exceed 12 per cent per annum, while the interest rate for an unsecured loan (without collateral) cannot exceed 18 per cent per annum. Any interest rates exceeding these limits render the moneylending agreement void and unenforceable. Strictly no house or workplace visits Loan sharks are notorious for intimidating defaulters by throwing red paint at their houses or workplaces. They may also resort to shaming tactics, such as posting pictures of defaulters in their neighbourhoods, claiming they owe money to loan sharks. However, Section 29(B) of the Act strictly prohibits moneylenders or their representatives from visiting or monitoring a borrower’s home or workplace. A moneylender found guilty of this offence can be fined between RM50,000 and RM250,000, or jailed for up to three years, or both. Representatives of the moneylender who are found guilty can face fines ranging from RM10,000 to RM50,000, imprisonment for up to two years, or both. If the harassment causes harm to another person, the offender may also face up to two years of imprisonment and whipping under the Act.   "
2024-12-04,"Beware, loan sharks are now on Tik Tok! Here’s how they bait students using social media influencers",https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/12/04/beware-loan-sharks-are-now-on-tik-tok-heres-how-they-bait-students-using-social-media-influencers/157987,"KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 3 — Loan sharks have traded posters on trees and lamp posts for flashy advertisements on social media platforms like TikTok, targeting school students in a worrying new trend. The illegal lenders are luring students, particularly those hooked on online gambling or frequent travel, with offers of “emergency loans” or “quick loans” that appear easy and hassle-free. The shift came to light when a 15-year-old boy from Selangor recently revealed he had racked up RM13,000 in debt to 12 loan sharks. The teenager said he borrowed the money to indulge his girlfriend’s craving forsiakap tiga rasa— barramundi cooked in a spicy, sweet, and sour sauce. While students may seem like unlikely targets due to their limited pocket money, loan sharks are finding the strategy profitable, thanks to the reach and influence of social media. Isaac, a loan shark agent who spoke on condition of anonymity, explained that TikTok and other platforms have become lucrative avenues for illegal moneylenders.   “They hire agents to scout for influencers with a large following, offering them advertisement deals to promote loan services,” he said. This new tactic highlights how loan sharks are evolving to exploit digital platforms, raising concerns about the risks posed to vulnerable young users. He said some social media influencers can earn up to RM2,000 by pinning loan shark advertisements on their pages for just two days. If their followers show interest in borrowing money, the influencers connect them to an agent, who then refers them to the loan sharks. “If you just type ‘loans’ on TikTok or Facebook, you’ll see many ‘ah long’ advertisements using phrases like ‘emergency loans’, ‘fast loans’, or ‘loans for those not working’. “No ‘ah long’ will openly admit they are one. “School students usually borrow from loan sharks because they want to go on vacations or cover expenses that their pocket money can’t accommodate. “Loan sharks typically lend between RM2,000 and RM5,000 to school students, charging interest rates of 10 to 20 per cent per week. “They conduct background checks on the students, and the wealthier their parents are, the higher the loan amounts they approve. “If a student introduces another friend to the loan shark, they receive a commission of about RM100 to RM200. While it’s not a significant amount, students looking to make quick cash often fall for this,” Isaac toldMalay Mail. When students fail to repay their debts on time — which is almost always the case — their parents are often forced to step in and negotiate with the loan sharks for a lump sum settlement. According to Isaac, the loan sharks typically demand that parents settle only the accumulated interest, which is still significantly higher than the amount initially borrowed by the student. If parents refuse to pay, loan sharks resort to public shaming by putting up posters in the student’s neighbourhood, declaring that they owe money to ‘ah longs’. To avoid such embarrassment, most parents end up paying. Some parents, however, fall into deeper trouble by turning to middlemen who claim they can make the loan sharks go away. Isaac explained that these intermediaries often present themselves as champions fighting against illegal moneylenders on social media. While they negotiate settlements on behalf of the victims, these middlemen secretly take a cut from the payment without the victim or the loan shark realising it. “The victim believes they’ve fully settled the loan, but the loan shark continues to chase them, thinking there’s still an outstanding balance,” he said.

Housing and Local Government Minister Nga Kor Ming said this was based on an initial report issued by the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia) and the Ipoh City Council (MBI). “The results of initial investigations by the Ipoh City Council and the Malaysian Fire and Rescue Department (JBPM) showed that continuous rain around Ipoh since Saturday had caused the water level of the Kinta River to rise sharply. “The next day, the continuous rain caused the river water to overflow into residential areas, affecting about 200 households in the Arena Kepayang Putra and Fair Park areas,” he said in a statement today. On Dec 1, residents and rescue teams had to wade through water filled with garbage and oil to help evacuate victims stranded by the flood, in addition to the flash floods that occurred in the area being described as the worst in the past 30 years. Therefore, Nga, who is the state assemblyman for Kepayang, said the government was considering a proposal to upgrade the river embankment along the Kinta River as a long-term solution to address the risk of flooding due to increasingly serious climate change. Nga said the DAP, JBPM and MBI service teams had taken immediate action to carry out clean-up operations after the flood waters had completely receded today. He said based on the rainfall intensity category under the Irrigation and Drainage Department, rainfall exceeding 60mm per hour was classified as very heavy rain with more than 60mm of rain within two to four hours causing flash floods. “The Kinta area also recorded monthly rainfall that exceeded the long-term average in November with a total of 370.2 mm compared to the average of 298.5 mm. “To prevent such incidents, the federal government has approved RM108.5 million for the flood mitigation project in Sungai Kinta/Kampar,” he said. — Bernama  "
2024-12-04,Najib: ‘Only fools would believe’ I would risk my career to receive just US$20m as Malaysia’s most powerful person,https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/12/04/najib-only-fools-would-believe-i-would-risk-my-career-to-receive-just-us20m-as-malaysias-most-powerful-person/158844,"KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 4 — Former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak today said it is unbelievable to think that he would stake his position as the head of government at the time to commit a crime for just US$20 million of 1MDB’s funds in 2011 in his personal AmIslamic bank account. Challenging this accusation that he would abuse his powers for US$20 million, Najib pointed out he was the most powerful official in Malaysia then as the prime minister. “Yet, the prosecution alleges that I – while holding the two most powerful positions in terms of being the head of the government of Malaysia and the head of the financial sector of public spending, prime minister and finance minister respectively – would jeopardise my political career and reputation, built over 40 years, to commit a criminal act for the sake of receiving US$9,999,977 on two separate occasions. “This is a desperate claim that only fools would believe,” he told the High Court when testifying in his 1MDB trial. Najib was responding to the prosecution’s assertion under his first power abuse charge that he abused his position to direct the 1MDB board of directors to pass a resolution authorising the company to join a US$1 billion joint venture with PetroSaudi International Limited in order to receive the US$20 million. The prosecution said Najib received the US$20 million in two tranches of US$9,999,977 or over US$9.99 million on February 24, 2011 and on June 14, 2011, which originated from US$700 million – from 1MDB’s US$1 billion for the joint venture – that was diverted in 2009 to Low Taek Jho’s Good Star Limited. Najib said he was not involved in the misappropriation of 1MDB money, and claimed there is no evidence that any of 1MDB’s US$700 million misappropriated through Good Star came to him. While the prosecution produced a money trail report showing how US$20 million originating from 1MDB’s US$700 million reached Najib’s account, the man himself challenged the assertion. Najib said the money trail report had distorted the facts. He described the power abuse charge against him as baseless and absurd, contrasting the idea that he was willing to undertake a crime for just tens of millions with others who he claimed received hundreds of millions in 1MDB funds. He named the Malaysian fugitive better known as Jho Low, and PetroSaudi officials, notably its CEO Tarek Obaid and its chief investment officer Patrick Mahony as having received much more money than him. Najib said the prosecution paints him as the “most generous and self-sacrificing” alleged co-conspirator in history, but called this claim illogical and defying common sense. “The prosecution’s narrative essentially alleges that I generously enabled everyone to enrich themselves with hundreds of millions while I, purportedly Jho Low’s ‘mirror image’ and the so-called joint mastermind of this scheme, received a mere fraction of the spoils years later, while on the other hand Jho Low immediately would receive a total of US$547 million, Tarek Obaid US$120 million and Patrick Mahony US$33 million,” he said. He said even Mahony as a company employee received US$33 million, adding that Low and Tarek used the hundreds of millions to buy multi-million dollar properties, luxury jewellery and other extravagant items. Najib claimed that Low, Tarek and Mahony orchestrated an elaborate deception to misappropriate and siphon off 1MDB’s US$700 million, and said he was not involved in this scheme. “Importantly, the court made no mention of me as a participant in these fraudulent transactions or as a recipient of any laundered funds,” he said, referring to the Switzerland Federal Criminal Court’s August 28 decision which convicted Tarek and Mahony for their role in a US$1.8 billion 1MDB fraud case. In the 1MDB trial, Najib is facing 25 criminal charges, including four charges of abusing his power for RM2.27 billion for his own financial benefit, and 21 money laundering charges involving over RM2 billion of 1MDB funds. On the first day of trial, the prosecution said it would prove that Najib had made it clear to 1MDB officers and 1MDB directors that Low was his alter ego, and that Low was Najib’s mirror image and that they had acted as one.

South China Morning Postreported that the incident occurred in Mae Sot, Tak province, near the Thai-Myanmar border, where local police received reports on November 24 of eerie cries emerging from the forest at night. The man, identified as 22-year-old Liu Chuanyi, later said through a translator, “I shouted for help once every hour to conserve my strength.” On Sunday evening, members of a passing patrol unit heard someone crying but were unsure of its source. The chief officer then shouted, and the man shouted back, so they began searching for him and called a rescue team from the Mae Sot Pitakkarn Foundation, theBangkok Postreported. They traced the sound to a dry well, where Liu was found trapped at the bottom. The rescue operation by the authorities took 30 minutes. Liu was discovered in a weakened state, suffering from a fractured left wrist, a cerebral concussion and multiple bruises, and was immediately taken to a hospital. Villagers had reportedly heard strange cries for several nights, but avoided investigating, believing the sounds to be supernatural.

2024-12-04,Family first: Biden joins list of US presidents pardoning relatives,https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/04/family-first-biden-joins-list-of-us-presidents-pardoning-relatives/158778,"WASHINGTON, Dec 4 — US presidents traditionally dole out pardons as they leave office but Joe Biden’s “full and unconditional” pardon of his son Hunter is a rare instance involving a family member. Bill Clinton granted a pardon to his half-brother Roger, who had served time in prison on 1985 drug charges, on January 20, 2001, his last day in office. And Donald Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, a fellow real estate magnate whose son Jared is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka, at the end of his first term in the White House. Trump, now president-elect, nominated Kushner, 70, who pleaded guilty in 2004 to tax evasion, witness tampering and making illegal campaign contributions, on Saturday to be the next US ambassador to France. Kushner, who served 14 months in prison, admitted hiring a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, who was cooperating in the campaign finance inquiry, and sending a videotape of the encounter to his own sister. Hunter Biden, who has struggled with alcohol and drug addiction, is the first child of a sitting president to receive a pardon. His father, who leaves office on January 20, had repeatedly said he would not pardon his son — but in announcing the move on Sunday he claimed that Hunter had been “selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted.” “I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice,” Biden said. “No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter’s cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son — and that is wrong,” the president said. Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to tax evasion in September and was facing up to 17 years in prison. He risked 25 years in prison for the felony gun charge but was not expected to receive such stiff sentences in either case. Presidents have also used their constitutionally-mandated pardon powers over the years on close friends and political allies. One of the most controversial pardons in recent years was that of former president Richard Nixon by his successor in the White House, Gerald Ford. Ford granted a “full and unconditional” pardon to Nixon, who was facing potential prosecution over the Watergate scandal, on September 8, 1974. Trump is the first former president convicted of a crime — falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star — but he will not be able to pardon himself because the case involved state and not federal charges. — AFP  "
2024-12-04,"Everyone is heading to PJ Section 14’s Wong Shi Fu Taiwan Dumpling for a taste of their dumplings, fried rice and stir-fried string beans",https://www.malaymail.com/news/eat-drink/2024/12/04/everyone-is-heading-to-pj-section-14s-wong-shi-fu-taiwan-dumpling-for-a-taste-of-their-dumplings-fried-rice-and-stir-fried-string-beans/158839,"PETALING JAYA, Dec 4 — Walk into Wong Shi Fu Taiwan Dumpling to find a Taiwanese-centric menu. It’s designed to showcase their key product, the Taiwanese style dumplings, produced by the owner’s family. As his mother is Taiwanese, the compact menu also reflects her roots with familiar favourites like fried rice, scallion oil noodles and stir-fried string beans. Astute diners will recognise the distinctive fried rice with plump, separate grains mixed with egg shreds and topped with plump prawns, a hallmark of Din Tai Fung, arguably Taiwan’s most famous export. It seems the chef here picked up his skills from there. As dumplings are the highlight, it’s on every table. The pork dumplings have different variations, filled with chives, cabbage, spring onions and prawns.   You can enjoy them boiled or pan fried where it’s transformed into gyoza. When boiled, the dumplings have a slight chewy texture with anal dentebite. It’s plump with fillings like chopped spring onions and cabbage, that gives it a subtle sweetness. The Taiwanese version of dumplings lean towards a more elegant and fresh bite. Magic happens when you order the Pork & Prawn Gyoza (RM15.90). They’re perfectly pan fried where the skin has crispy edges. Inside, you will discover a juicy pork filling and a whole prawn. It’s not often you see a whole prawn as dumplings usually are filled with chopped prawns mixed with minced pork. Both types of dumplings are served with a soy sauce dip that adds a layer of flavour. For the dumplings, each order has six pieces with prices that range from RM11.90 to RM14.90. They charge an extra RM1 for the pan fried variant.   On every table, there’s also a plate of the glorious Taiwanese Fried Rice with Shrimp and Kampung Egg (RM19.90). If it’s quiet, one can hear the high intensity of the fire, required to make this plate of fried rice. Each plump grain is distinct and intertwined with chopped spring onions and bits of the friedkampungegg. The prawns are juicy and crunchy too, making it a memorable fried rice. String Beans with Minced Pork (RM17.90) have a bright green hue, signalling exemplary wok skills. Each baby spring bean is sufficiently blistered from the heat.   You may find it slightly sweet though, which I don’t mind. Apparently, this is how the Taiwanese like it as they have a deep love for sugar, which was once produced in huge quantities back in the 18th century. And for those who prefer noodles, they serve scallion oil noodles here. Theal dentestrands are tossed in a soy sauce mix that uses scallion- or spring onion-infused oil. It may look simple but it has a light flavour that grows on you.   You can order the Noodles with Special Sauce on its own for RM6.90 or opt for the noodles paired with your choice of dumplings. This combination gives you three dumplings, making it a one-dish meal. Prices range from RM12.90 to RM15.90. At night, they serve two additional dishes, namely Spicy Pickled Cucumber and Stir Fried Green Dragon Vegetable.   And if you’re like me, a fanatic dumpling fan who keeps frozen dumplings in the freezer as emergency food, you can also buy packs of the dumplings here. They also distribute to many other supermarkets, making it a convenient purchase whenever you want to get your dumplings fix.   Wong Shi Fu Taiwan Dumpling, 34, Jalan 14/22, Section 14, Petaling Jaya. Open: 11.30am to 3pm, 5pm to 10pm. Closed on Monday. Tel:016-7387455.

2024-12-04,Trump makes global comeback with first international trip for Notre Dame grand reopening,https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/03/trump-makes-global-comeback-with-first-international-trip-for-notre-dame-grand-reopening/158773,"WASHINGTON, Dec 3 — Donald Trump will attend the weekend reopening of the restored Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, in his first trip abroad as US president-elect, he announced on social media yesterday. The 850-year-old edifice which was ravaged by a fire in 2019 will welcome visitors and worshippers again this Saturday and Sunday, with dozens of world leaders expected among the guests. “It is an honour to announce that I will be traveling to Paris, France, on Saturday to attend the re-opening of the Magnificent and Historic Notre Dame Cathedral, which has been fully restored after a devastating fire five years ago,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social network. French President Emmanuel Macron, who set the ambitious goal of rebuilding Notre Dame within five years, conducted an inspection of the restoration on Friday, saying workers had done the “impossible” by healing a “national wound”. Trump posted on Truth Social that Macron had “done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!” After Trump first took office in 2017, his relations with Macron — then a fresh new face on the world stage, boosted by a resounding election win of his own — had the initial makings of a “bromance”. Ties later cooled, as the US leader pressed on with a steady retreat from multilateralism that at times ran counter to Macron’s position. As the fire ravaged the fragile cathedral in 2019, Trump urged the use of water bombers to put out the blaze, earning the ridicule of the French fire services. Some 250 companies and hundreds of experts were ultimately brought in for restoration work costing a total of nearly 700 million euros (RM3.3 billion). It was financed from the 846 million euros in donations that poured in from 150 countries in a surge of solidarity. Macron said in December 2023 he had invited Pope Francis to the reopening of the cathedral, but the head of the Catholic church announced in September, to the surprise of some observers, that he would not be coming. Instead, the pontiff is making a landmark visit the following weekend to the French island of Corsica. — AFP  "
2024-12-04,Najib: I never approved Jho Low as my 1MDB orchestrator; ‘lying’ 1MDB officers conveniently blamed me,https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/12/03/najib-i-never-approved-jho-low-as-my-1mdb-orchestrator-lying-1mdb-officers-conveniently-blamed-me/158801," KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 3 — Former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak today said he had never consented to having Low Taek Jho — a Malaysian fugitive better known as Jho Low — act as an “orchestrator” on his behalf at 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), and was not aware of Low playing such a role. Najib accused former 1MDB officers — who had testified in the High Court in the 1MDB trial against him — of “lying” and conveniently placing the “entire blame” for 1MDB’s financial scandal on him. “It is convenient for Shahrol, Amhari, Hazem, Azmi, and Jasmine to place blame on me, as this narrative shields them from accountability for the criminal activities they knowingly, consciously, and deliberately executed on Jho Low’s behalf,” Najib claimed when testifying as the first defence witness in the 1MDB trial. Najib was referring to 1MDB’s former CEOs Datuk Shahrol Azral Ibrahim Halmi and Mohd Hazem Abd Rahman, 1MDB’s then in-house lawyer Jasmine Loo, 1MDB’s then chief financial officer Azmi Tahir, and Najib’s then own special officer Datuk Amhari Efendi Nazaruddin. Najib claimed that these former officials have no evidence to show an alleged top-down approach in 1MDB, and instead claimed that evidence in the 1MDB trial showed their alleged knowing participation in Low’s conspiracy to defraud 1MDB. “In the face of that, what can these lying individuals do to defend themselves but to come out with a unified claim of top down approach and that Jho Low somehow they thought represented me,” he said. Disputing Shahrol’s court testimony, Najib said he had never given his blessings or approval for the talking points — that Low provided to 1MDB officers — containing instructions for major 1MDB deals and transactions. “If these talking points had truly carried my blessing, then why would Datuk Shahrol go to such lengths to destroy them? By his admission, he received over 100 of these talking points, yet he deliberately chose to destroy them. ”This act supports that the talking points didn’t have my blessing and were not to protect me. “If he genuinely believed these talking points had my endorsement, he would have preserved them to support his defence that he was simply following instructions with my supposed approval,” Najib said. Najib said he had never seen any of these talking points and was surprised these might have been used to impress 1MDB board members that he had given his blessing for these talking points. Among other things, Najib denied communicating with Low on 1MDB matters, also saying he did not know any instructions given or actions taken by Low on his behalf for 1MDB. “Any claims that Jho Low acted with my ‘approval’ or ‘blessing’ are baseless. “I did not authorise Jho Low to draft or deliver any talking points or action plans to Shahrol, Jasmine, Hazem, Azmi or any other members of the management or the 1MDB BOD or to any of my officers, Amhari, Datuk Azlin or Wan Shihab nor did I direct Jho Low to carry out decisions or provide instructions to 1MDB management, the 1MDB BOD, my officers, Amhari, Datuk Azlin or Wan Shihab,” he said. Najib was referring to his former principal private secretary Datuk Azlin Alias and his former special officer Datuk Wan Ahmad Shihab Wan Ismail. Najib said he was unaware of an alleged “work in silo” work culture in 1MDB, claiming that former 1MDB officers were using this as an excuse for their unauthorised actions on 1MDB matters. “Any decisions made or actions taken by them on Jho Low’s instructions were done independently of me, and any suggestion otherwise is a misrepresentation of the true state of affairs,” he claimed. Najib’s 1MDB trial before judge Datuk Collin Lawrence Sequerah resumes tomorrow morning.   "

The signing, originally planned for Dec 9 during the two countries’ annual leaders’ retreat, had to be called off after Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong contracted Covid-19 this week, Anwar told Dewan Rakyat. On Tuesday, Wong said on Facebook he was self-isolating at home after testing positive for Covid-19 for the first time. The Southeast Asian neighbours in January agreed to develop the SEZ in Johor, just north of Singapore, aiming to attract investment and free up the movement of goods and people. Proposals for the project include a passport-free immigration clearance system, cooperation on renewable energy and simplifying business approvals. — Reuters   "
2024-12-04,Najib: ‘Only fools would believe’ I would risk my career to receive just US$20m as Malaysia’s most powerful person,https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/12/04/najib-only-fools-would-believe-i-would-risk-my-career-to-receive-just-us20m-as-malaysias-most-powerful-person/158844,"KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 4 — Former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak today said it is unbelievable to think that he would stake his position as the head of government at the time to commit a crime for just US$20 million of 1MDB’s funds in 2011 in his personal AmIslamic bank account. Challenging this accusation that he would abuse his powers for US$20 million, Najib pointed out he was the most powerful official in Malaysia then as the prime minister. “Yet, the prosecution alleges that I – while holding the two most powerful positions in terms of being the head of the government of Malaysia and the head of the financial sector of public spending, prime minister and finance minister respectively – would jeopardise my political career and reputation, built over 40 years, to commit a criminal act for the sake of receiving US$9,999,977 on two separate occasions. “This is a desperate claim that only fools would believe,” he told the High Court when testifying in his 1MDB trial. Najib was responding to the prosecution’s assertion under his first power abuse charge that he abused his position to direct the 1MDB board of directors to pass a resolution authorising the company to join a US$1 billion joint venture with PetroSaudi International Limited in order to receive the US$20 million. The prosecution said Najib received the US$20 million in two tranches of US$9,999,977 or over US$9.99 million on February 24, 2011 and on June 14, 2011, which originated from US$700 million – from 1MDB’s US$1 billion for the joint venture – that was diverted in 2009 to Low Taek Jho’s Good Star Limited. Najib said he was not involved in the misappropriation of 1MDB money, and claimed there is no evidence that any of 1MDB’s US$700 million misappropriated through Good Star came to him. While the prosecution produced a money trail report showing how US$20 million originating from 1MDB’s US$700 million reached Najib’s account, the man himself challenged the assertion. Najib said the money trail report had distorted the facts. He described the power abuse charge against him as baseless and absurd, contrasting the idea that he was willing to undertake a crime for just tens of millions with others who he claimed received hundreds of millions in 1MDB funds. He named the Malaysian fugitive better known as Jho Low, and PetroSaudi officials, notably its CEO Tarek Obaid and its chief investment officer Patrick Mahony as having received much more money than him. Najib said the prosecution paints him as the “most generous and self-sacrificing” alleged co-conspirator in history, but called this claim illogical and defying common sense. “The prosecution’s narrative essentially alleges that I generously enabled everyone to enrich themselves with hundreds of millions while I, purportedly Jho Low’s ‘mirror image’ and the so-called joint mastermind of this scheme, received a mere fraction of the spoils years later, while on the other hand Jho Low immediately would receive a total of US$547 million, Tarek Obaid US$120 million and Patrick Mahony US$33 million,” he said. He said even Mahony as a company employee received US$33 million, adding that Low and Tarek used the hundreds of millions to buy multi-million dollar properties, luxury jewellery and other extravagant items. Najib claimed that Low, Tarek and Mahony orchestrated an elaborate deception to misappropriate and siphon off 1MDB’s US$700 million, and said he was not involved in this scheme. “Importantly, the court made no mention of me as a participant in these fraudulent transactions or as a recipient of any laundered funds,” he said, referring to the Switzerland Federal Criminal Court’s August 28 decision which convicted Tarek and Mahony for their role in a US$1.8 billion 1MDB fraud case. In the 1MDB trial, Najib is facing 25 criminal charges, including four charges of abusing his power for RM2.27 billion for his own financial benefit, and 21 money laundering charges involving over RM2 billion of 1MDB funds. On the first day of trial, the prosecution said it would prove that Najib had made it clear to 1MDB officers and 1MDB directors that Low was his alter ego, and that Low was Najib’s mirror image and that they had acted as one.

Months after heated debate over the PAS-led Terengganu’s decision to drop its two Muslim women divers from competing in Sukma 2024 due to their attire, Deputy Youth and Sports Minister Adam Adli Abd Halim clarified that the federal government does not prohibit sporting organisers from imposing dress codes for women athletes. “If we look at hosting sporting events in our country, we do give way for any organiser to attach conditions on attire and others. “For example, in Terengganu, when hosting sporting events that involve women, we don’t have any objection when conditions on attire were implemented,” Adam Adli said. He said such decisions were made as part of a compromise involving all stakeholders in sports, not just the Youth and Sports Ministry, but also state sports councils and grassroots organisations as every state and district has its own norms. He also noted that if a dress code does not affect the athletes’ performance and is agreed upon by all parties involved, the ministry would always consider the best possible solution. “Athletes in our country are free to dress according to their needs and preferences; some adhere to religious guidelines, while others are more open. “We consistently leave this choice to them,” he said in reply to Permatang Pauh MP Muhammad Fawwaz Mohamad Jan from PAS who asked if the government planned to introduce guidelines for women’s attire in sports without compromising culture, religion, and modesty. The deputy minister also mentioned that the ministry had consistently hosted events to empower women in sports last year and will continue to do so throughout 2024, adding that it has an agenda called ‘Women Empowerment in Sports’. Adam Adli’s statement today is a departure from Youth and Sports Minister Hannah Yeoh’s August 28 expression of concern about Terengganu’s dress code directive on its two Muslim women divers for the Malaysia Games hosted by Sarawak. In her Facebook post back then, Yeoh asserted that the state government’s directive “could stifle the potential of young talents and negatively affect the overall development of sports in the country”. https://www.malaymail.com/news/sports/2024/08/14/terengganu-only-perikatan-state-to-not-send-female-gymnasts-to-sukma-2024-over-attire-concerns/146946"

The co-founder and former chairman of Renong Berhad – the conglomerate that once controlled much infrastructure, construction, and property development projects in the country – said he received an official clearance letter from MACC on December 4 last year, news portalFree Malaysia Todayreported. “This letter confirms that there was no evidence of any wrongdoing on my part in relation to the investigation,” he was quoted as saying in the news report this morning. Halim added that he remains involved as a witness in the ongoing MACC investigation. “I remain committed to fully cooperating with the authorities as they continue their work.” Halim’s statement comes after inquiries were made about MACC’s investigation, which began in May 2023, into political figures from the 1990s, including speculation linking him to the 1997 acquisition of Renong shares by United Engineers (M) Bhd for RM2.3 billion. At the time of the investigation, Halim had dismissed media claims that he had been questioned by MACC amid rumours that the commission was investigating a former senior minister and a businessman with a “Tan Sri” title in connection with the alleged embezzlement of state funds.

Health officials met with directors of education institutes on Monday in the capital Kabul to inform them of the ruling, an official from the public health ministry who was not authorised to speak to the media told AFP. “There is no official letter but the directors of institutes were informed in a meeting that women and girls can’t study anymore in their institutes,” he said. “They were not provided with any details and justification and were just told of the order of the supreme leader and were asked to implement it.” The manager of an institute who attended the meeting and asked not to be named for fear of reprisal said dozens of managers were in attendance. A senior employee of another centre told AFP his boss had been at a separate meeting with health officials on Tuesday after confusion about the rule. The employee said institutes had been given 10 days to hold final exams. Some managers petitioned the ministry for clarity, while others carried on as normal in the absence of a written order. Not long after Taliban authorities swept back to power in 2021, they barred girls from education beyond secondary school as part of restrictions labelled “gender apartheid” by the United Nations. Women students then flocked to health institutes, one of the few avenues still open to them. They now make up the majority of students in these centres. Afghanistan has around 10 public and more than 150 private health institutes offering two-year diplomas in 18 subjects, ranging from midwifery to anaesthesia, pharmacy and dentistry, with a total of 35,000 women students, health ministry sources said. “What are we supposed to do with just 10 per cent of our students?” one manager said. Aysha — not her real name — a midwifery teacher at a private institute in Kabul, said she received a message from management telling her not to come to work until further notice with little explanation. “This is a big shock for us. Psychologically, we are shaken,” the 28-year-old said. “This was the only source of hope for the girls and women who were banned from universities.” The United Kingdom’s charge d’affaires said he was “deeply concerned” by the reports. “This is another affront to women’s right to education and will further restrict access to healthcare for Afghan women and children,” he posted on social media platform X. The health ministry source said the ban would squeeze an already suffering health sector. “We are already short of professional medical and para-medical staff and this would result in further shortages.” — AFP  "

With brutal conflicts spiralling in places like Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, and as climate change and extreme weather take an ever-heavier toll, the UN estimated that 305 million people globally will need some form of emergency assistance next year. “We are dealing with a poly-crisis right now globally, and it is the most vulnerable people in the world who are paying the price,” Fletcher said, warning that swelling inequality combined with the convergence of conflict and climate change had created a “perfect storm” of needs. Launching the Global Humanitarian Overview, Fletcher acknowledged that the UN and its partners would not be able to reach all of those in need. The annual appeal by UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations is seeking US$47.4 billion for 2025 — slightly less than the appeal for this year — which it said was enough to provide assistance to the 189.5 million most vulnerable people. “There’s 115 million that we won’t be able to reach” with this plan, Fletcher acknowledged. ‘Ruthless’ Pointing to significant “donor fatigue” hitting humanitarian operations around the world, he stressed the need to lay out a “realistic” plan, which will require prioritisation and making “really tough, tough choices”. “We’ve got to be absolutely focused on reaching those in the most dire need, and really ruthless,” he said. As of last month, only 43 per cent of the US$50-billion appeal for this year had been met. Underfunding has this year seen an 80-per cent reduction in food assistance in Syria, cuts to protection services in Myanmar, and diminished water and sanitation aid in cholera-prone Yemen, the UN said. The single biggest barriers for assisting and protecting people in armed conflict, though, were the widespread violations of international law. 2024 has already been the deadliest year for humanitarian workers, surpassing last year’s toll of 280 killed. The global humanitarian system “is overstretched, it’s underfunded and it’s literally under attack”, Fletcher said. “We need a surge in global solidarity.” Fears meanwhile abound that Donald Trump’s looming return to the presidency in the United States — the world’s biggest humanitarian donor — could see aid agency budgets cut rather than raised next year. Fletcher said he planned to “spend a lot of time in Washington” in coming months to engage with the new administration. ‘Unconscionable’ The “much tougher global climate (was) not just about America”, he said, adding he planned “to bash down doors” around the world and make the argument about the need to step up. A record 123 million people were living displaced from their homes due to conflict by mid-2024, while one out of every five children globally is currently living in or fleeing conflict zones, according to UN figures. “The suffering behind the numbers is all the more unconscionable for being man-made,” Fletcher said. “Wars in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine are marked by the ferocity and intensity of the killing, the complete disregard for international law, and the deliberate obstruction of our humanitarian movement’s effort to save lives.” Numerous old crises meanwhile remain unresolved and simmering, with average humanitarian operations now spanning a decade, the UN said. “The longer they last, the bleaker the prospects,” Fletcher warned, pointing out that “life expectancy drops, vaccination rates plummet, education suffers, maternal mortality skyrockets, and the spectre of famine grows”. Even more worryingly, he said, was how conflicts were increasingly converging with the climate-induced disasters that are ravaging communities, devastating food systems and driving mass displacement. “The dread I have is that those two huge drivers of need are now combining,” he said. — AFP  "

TheTaiwan Timesreported that the court also imposed a fine of NT$100,000 (RM13,741), and Huang retains the right to appeal the decision. Prosecutors discovered seven explicit images of underage girls on Huang’s hard drive during an investigation earlier this year. Huang was indicted in May after prosecutors uncovered the materials while probing sexual assault allegations against him. In late July, investigators found 41 additional explicit images of minors, with some victims as young as 11 years old. Prosecutors said Huang had been a member of an online forum where he obtained and stored these materials from February 2014. He began storing the images on an external hard drive in February last year. In aseparate incidentin June 2023, Huang attempted suicide after being accused of sexual harassment by multiple women, including actresses Bowie Tsang and Phoebe Huang. He was hospitalised after jumping from a building but survived. Huang admitted to his actions in a public apology before his suicide attempt, saying he had committed “unforgivable mistakes.” Today’s verdict comes as part of the fallout from these investigations, with the court emphasising the seriousness of possessing exploitative materials involving minors.

2024-12-04,"Fifa to reveal Club World Cup draw amid apathy, legal threats",https://www.malaymail.com/news/sports/2024/12/04/fifa-to-reveal-club-world-cup-draw-amid-apathy-legal-threats/158845,"MIAMI, Dec 4 — The draw for the expanded Fifa Club World Cup takes place in Miami today, offering a first glimpse into the fine detail of a tournament that has been viewed with indifference or even outright hostility across parts of the football world. Thirty-two star-studded club teams will battle it out in gleaming state-of-the-art arenas in what is effectively a curtain-raiser for the 2026 World Cup taking place a year later in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In theory, the new-look competition ought to be an enticing prospect that sells itself: a month-long football festival, the first large-scale club tournament to feature teams from all corners of the globe. Yet for many, Fifa president Gianni Infantino’s passion project is a tournament too far, an unwelcome addition to an already crowded global calendar that exhausted players say has pushed them close to breaking point. The loudest antipathy towards the tournament, and Fifa, has come from Europe. In October, an umbrella grouping of top European leagues, together with the players’ union, FIFPro, filed a legal complaint to the European Commission accusing Fifa of abusing its position over its handling of the international fixture calendar. Player frustration Javier Tebas, the chief of Spain’s La Liga, has been one of the Club World Cup’s most outspoken critics, telling Infantino in October to cancel the tournament, citing apathy from broadcasters and opposition from clubs. “Mr President, you know you have not sold the broadcast rights for the Club World Cup, you know you have not sold any sponsorship rights,” said Tebas. “Scrap the Club World Cup. It is not needed by the players, the clubs or Fifa.” Players, meanwhile, have spoken of frustration at an ever-lengthening fixture schedule that leaves them with fewer opportunities for rest and recuperation. Manchester City and Spain star Rodri, the winner of this year’s Ballon d’Or, warned in September that players were “close” to striking over the calendar, citing the demands imposed by this season’s expanded UEFA Champions League followed by the Club World Cup. “If it keeps this way we will have no other option,” Rodri said of possible industrial action. “It is something that worries us.” Fifa though has pushed back at the criticism forcefully, insisting that its calendar was approved by the Fifa Council following consultation from all continents including Europe as well as FIFPro and league bodies. The world football body also took aim at leagues in Europe who have opposed the tournament, accusing them of “acting with commercial self-interest and hypocrisy” while preferring a calendar “filled with friendlies and summer tours.” ‘Something historic’ - Infantino meanwhile has brushed off the criticism, insisting that the launch of the expanded club tournament will usher in a new era for world football. “The Fifa Club World Cup next year will bring the magic of a national team (Fifa) World Cup into the realm of club football, and this tournament will be the start of something historic, something that will change our sport for the better, and for future generations, who will come to love it as much as we do,” Infantino said last month. Yet the opportunity to embrace the historic opportunity touted by Fifa has so far failed to excite broadcasters. Fifa, which is reportedly seeking US$4 billion in media rights revenue for the tournament, has not confirmed a rights deal. The tournament itself will take place from June 15 to July 13, 2025, with the opening match hosted by Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium and the final taking place at the MetLife Stadium in New York—the venue for the 2026 World Cup final. Europe will provide the largest contingent of teams, with 12 sides including Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan taking part. South America will field six teams, with Africa, Asia and the CONCACAF region receiving four slots each. Oceania will be represented by New Zealand’s Auckland City, while host nation the US has an additional slot, controversially awarded to Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami despite the team being bundled out in the first round of the MLS Cup playoffs this year. — AFP  "

Two United States citizens and a Canadian national were reported missing Monday evening after failing to show up for a pre-arranged flight. Police said the alpine terrain of 3,700-metre Mount Cook was “difficult to navigate” and bad weather had forced them to suspend the search until at least Thursday. “Police hold grave concerns for the three men,” they said in a statement. Rescue teams had earlier found several pieces of discarded climbing gear they believed belonged to the men. The two US citizens were identified as Kurt Blair, 56, and Carlos Romero, 50. Police withheld the name of the Canadian climber “due to family wishes”. New Zealand’s official tourism body recommends that only “well-prepared, experienced mountaineers” attempt to tackle Mount Cook. “The weather can change very suddenly—be prepared for heavy rainfall, snow and/or high winds.” — AFP  "

South China Morning Postreported that the incident occurred in Mae Sot, Tak province, near the Thai-Myanmar border, where local police received reports on November 24 of eerie cries emerging from the forest at night. The man, identified as 22-year-old Liu Chuanyi, later said through a translator, “I shouted for help once every hour to conserve my strength.” On Sunday evening, members of a passing patrol unit heard someone crying but were unsure of its source. The chief officer then shouted, and the man shouted back, so they began searching for him and called a rescue team from the Mae Sot Pitakkarn Foundation, theBangkok Postreported. They traced the sound to a dry well, where Liu was found trapped at the bottom. The rescue operation by the authorities took 30 minutes. Liu was discovered in a weakened state, suffering from a fractured left wrist, a cerebral concussion and multiple bruises, and was immediately taken to a hospital. Villagers had reportedly heard strange cries for several nights, but avoided investigating, believing the sounds to be supernatural. Authorities suspect Liu wandered into the forest and accidentally fell into the well while trying to find his way out. Officials have contacted immigration authorities to determine why Liu was near the Thai-Myanmar border. Measures are being taken to seal the well to prevent similar incidents in the future.  "
2024-12-04,"Hong Kong mega development plan to devour villages, wetlands",https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/04/hong-kong-mega-development-plan-to-devour-villages-wetlands/158847,"HONG KONG, Dec 4 — For almost half a century, Kwok Hoi-yin’s humble cottage on Hong Kong’s border with mainland China was surrounded by leagues of fishponds and green fields, buffering the modern highrises of megacity Shenzhen to the north. In recent years his village has shrunk, nibbled away by roads and bridges as the government claims land for crossborder infrastructure and its Northern Metropolis project, an ambitious plan to urbanise the border area that has proceeded despite concerns from locals and environmentalists. Kwok’s bucolic idyll, near the city’s largest and most important wetlands, is long gone. Instead the view from his window is a grey stone wall, while an army of mosquitoes rises from the dead water remaining under his hut. “To put it politely we are sacrificing for the greater good, but to put it less politely, we have been sliced off, piece by piece,” Kwok, 69, told AFP. His 100-year-old village, Ha Wan Tsuen, might now be wiped out entirely. In September the government approved a plan to create an enormous new tech zone that will eventually swallow it up. “We hope they won’t tear down our village—that’s our most genuine but also most impossible wish,” Kwok, who has served as Ha Wan Tsuen’s elected chief for a decade, said. “Because it’s impossible for us to resist the government—it would be like a praying mantis trying to stop a chariot.” 90 per cent opposition Commonly known as the San Tin Technopole, the planned tech zone is the cherry on top of the Northern Metropolis. It will be the “core of industry development”, according to the government, providing a third of the Metropolis’ promised 500,000 new jobs. The wider project—which aims to deepen integration with mainland China—is set to transform 30,000 hectares of land along the border, about a third of Hong Kong’s territory. The Metropolis will house 2.5 million people, the government says. But those who already call the area home, like Kwok, had little chance to put their concerns about the development directly to the government. The last chance for ordinary people to speak out was a four-day hearing held by the Town Planning Board in the summer. A two-month consultation period before the hearing had resulted in a 90 per cent opposition rate from about 1,600 submissions—but the board still gave the project a green light. An evacuation date for Ha Wan Tsuen has not yet been set, nor has compensation. The government has also dismissed concerns over the project’s environmental impact. The Technopole will push up against a large protected wetland area, which has been UNESCO-recognised since 1995. The area around those wetlands—around 2,600 hectares of fishponds, rivers and marshes—had been designated by the Hong Kong government as a conservation and buffer zone, to limit development and preserve a complete eco-system. ‘Wetland damages’ The Technopole will take over 240 hectares of those zones, the government has admitted. “Over the past 30 years Hong Kong never had a development plan that would cause wetland damages in such a scale,” Wong Suet-mei, a conservation officer of the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society, told AFP. The government says most of the wetlands that will be affected have already changed beyond recognition. It says it will establish a wetland conservation park as “compensation”, along with other measures such as keeping a 300-metre flight path for birds. “Based on the previous experience in ecological compensation in other development projects, we are confident that the number of bird numbers will be maintained at the current level or even increase,” the Development Bureau told AFP. Chan Kwok-sun, an aquafarmer whose almost 40-year-old ponds are set to be filled in for the Technopole, remained doubtful. “No one can farm fish when the ponds are taken, no bird will come when there is no fish for them,” Chan told AFP. The 74-year-old farmer said he welcomed the government’s development plan though, as he has witnessed the rise of Shenzhen from “pure darkness like in primitive times” to “a mountain of skyscrapers”. However, he said he would stay among his ponds until the last day possible. “I live an unfettered life here,” Chan said. “It’s hard to find it elsewhere.” — AFP  "
2024-12-04,"Everyone is heading to PJ Section 14’s Wong Shi Fu Taiwan Dumpling for a taste of their dumplings, fried rice and stir-fried string beans",https://www.malaymail.com/news/eat-drink/2024/12/04/everyone-is-heading-to-pj-section-14s-wong-shi-fu-taiwan-dumpling-for-a-taste-of-their-dumplings-fried-rice-and-stir-fried-string-beans/158839,"PETALING JAYA, Dec 4 — Walk into Wong Shi Fu Taiwan Dumpling to find a Taiwanese-centric menu. It’s designed to showcase their key product, the Taiwanese style dumplings, produced by the owner’s family. As his mother is Taiwanese, the compact menu also reflects her roots with familiar favourites like fried rice, scallion oil noodles and stir-fried string beans. Astute diners will recognise the distinctive fried rice with plump, separate grains mixed with egg shreds and topped with plump prawns, a hallmark of Din Tai Fung, arguably Taiwan’s most famous export. It seems the chef here picked up his skills from there. As dumplings are the highlight, it’s on every table. The pork dumplings have different variations, filled with chives, cabbage, spring onions and prawns.   You can enjoy them boiled or pan fried where it’s transformed into gyoza. When boiled, the dumplings have a slight chewy texture with anal dentebite. It’s plump with fillings like chopped spring onions and cabbage, that gives it a subtle sweetness. The Taiwanese version of dumplings lean towards a more elegant and fresh bite. Magic happens when you order the Pork & Prawn Gyoza (RM15.90). They’re perfectly pan fried where the skin has crispy edges. Inside, you will discover a juicy pork filling and a whole prawn. It’s not often you see a whole prawn as dumplings usually are filled with chopped prawns mixed with minced pork. Both types of dumplings are served with a soy sauce dip that adds a layer of flavour. For the dumplings, each order has six pieces with prices that range from RM11.90 to RM14.90. They charge an extra RM1 for the pan fried variant.   On every table, there’s also a plate of the glorious Taiwanese Fried Rice with Shrimp and Kampung Egg (RM19.90). If it’s quiet, one can hear the high intensity of the fire, required to make this plate of fried rice. Each plump grain is distinct and intertwined with chopped spring onions and bits of the friedkampungegg. The prawns are juicy and crunchy too, making it a memorable fried rice. String Beans with Minced Pork (RM17.90) have a bright green hue, signalling exemplary wok skills. Each baby spring bean is sufficiently blistered from the heat.   You may find it slightly sweet though, which I don’t mind. Apparently, this is how the Taiwanese like it as they have a deep love for sugar, which was once produced in huge quantities back in the 18th century. And for those who prefer noodles, they serve scallion oil noodles here. Theal dentestrands are tossed in a soy sauce mix that uses scallion- or spring onion-infused oil. It may look simple but it has a light flavour that grows on you.   You can order the Noodles with Special Sauce on its own for RM6.90 or opt for the noodles paired with your choice of dumplings. This combination gives you three dumplings, making it a one-dish meal. Prices range from RM12.90 to RM15.90. At night, they serve two additional dishes, namely Spicy Pickled Cucumber and Stir Fried Green Dragon Vegetable.   And if you’re like me, a fanatic dumpling fan who keeps frozen dumplings in the freezer as emergency food, you can also buy packs of the dumplings here. They also distribute to many other supermarkets, making it a convenient purchase whenever you want to get your dumplings fix.   Wong Shi Fu Taiwan Dumpling, 34, Jalan 14/22, Section 14, Petaling Jaya. Open: 11.30am to 3pm, 5pm to 10pm. Closed on Monday. Tel:016-7387455.

The UK’s Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that Singapore authorities want him extradited over charges related to the abetment of cheating. According to a statement from Singapore’s Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on November 13, the request stems from allegations that Yeo was involved in the release of funds to his law firm, purportedly as part of a settlement sum in a client’s claim. UK court documents indicate the incident occurred between July 29 and November 30, 2020, the CNA report added. Yeo was arrested by UK authorities on November 4 and has been held in custody ever since. Despite being granted conditional bail for £75,000 (RM424,253) in November, his release has been delayed due to complications in verifying whether the UK Home Office still holds his passport. As an alternative to confirming his passport’s location, Yeo’s legal team had also attempted to cancel the passport at the Singapore High Commission in London. However, by yesterday’s hearing, they had yet to receive confirmation of the cancellation. The judge noted that confirmation from Singaporean authorities that the passport had been cancelled would satisfy the bail condition. “It seems to me you’ll have to wait until the Singapore authorities have that opportunity,” he remarked. Another hearing is scheduled for December 10, by which time Yeo’s legal team hopes to receive confirmation of the passport cancellation. If granted bail, Yeo will be subject to electronic monitoring, a strict curfew, and regular reporting to a police station while awaiting the full extradition hearing next year."

Now I have yet more tests to do, including a PET scan, to figure out just how far my cancer has progressed and how I should proceed treatment-wise. Am I terrified? Of course I am. Fear has never really stopped me from doing things (except maybe from visiting possibly haunted malls) because the more afraid I am of doing something, the more I push myself to move forward. Otherwise, I’d probably still be afraid of sleeping in the dark. The nice thing about getting cancer in my 40s is I’m past caring about things like losing a breast. A mastectomy is unfortunately unavoidable in my case and my doctor asked if I wanted a reconstruction. No thank you, I said. I’m thinking long-term; I don’t want it to be difficult to detect the cancer if it returns, and after 45 years of having a decent rack, I will just say thank you and goodbye, I will not miss having F cups. While I was calm in the waiting room and getting the news from my doctor, having to text people about the news made me cry. I so desperately wanted to give them good news. Still, I also felt better sharing the weight of it all because carrying it all myself is something I know I cannot bear. It’s something no one should bear alone. If life is a story, cancer is but a scary chapter of mine, and I’m just going to keep turning the pages and be grateful that friends and family have been wonderfully supportive throughout. Here’s to pressing on and hoping that I can give this tale a good ending. "

The Bagan Serai MP said its focus is always on the public good. “PAS, from the very beginning, has never been about competing for positions. “For example, when it came to choosing the Opposition leader. Our focus is on the people’s agenda,” Idris said during a dinner at the Bangi Golf Resort the party hosted for journalists. He added that PAS received praise from former prime minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Ismail who belongs to rival party Umno when both parties allied to govern the country during the Covid-19 pandemic. “Others held senior minister positions, but we didn’t ask for them. This is the attitude instilled in us. “We don’t mind. What’s important is consensus, and we see what matters to the people,” Idris added. PAS Spiritual Leader Datuk Hashim Jasin recently made an open call for the party to move forward and take charge of PN since it has the most number of seats of the three main Opposition parties in the Dewan Rakyat — 41 out of 222. PAS Youth chief Afnan Hamimi Taib Azamudden backed the call and mooted its secretary-general Datuk Seri Takiyuddin Hassan to also be the office-bearer for the coalition, instead of Datuk Seri Azmin Ali, who was recently named to the position by PN chairman and Bersatu president Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin. “Afnan was merely suggesting, not forcing. That’s normal. He’s with the youth and it’s part of his role,” Idris replied when asked about his party colleague’s proposal."

It’s designed to showcase their key product, the Taiwanese style dumplings, produced by the owner’s family. As his mother is Taiwanese, the compact menu also reflects her roots with familiar favourites like fried rice, scallion oil noodles and stir-fried string beans. Astute diners will recognise the distinctive fried rice with plump, separate grains mixed with egg shreds and topped with plump prawns, a hallmark of Din Tai Fung, arguably Taiwan’s most famous export. It seems the chef here picked up his skills from there. As dumplings are the highlight, it’s on every table. The pork dumplings have different variations, filled with chives, cabbage, spring onions and prawns.   You can enjoy them boiled or pan fried where it’s transformed into gyoza. When boiled, the dumplings have a slight chewy texture with anal dentebite. It’s plump with fillings like chopped spring onions and cabbage, that gives it a subtle sweetness. The Taiwanese version of dumplings lean towards a more elegant and fresh bite. Magic happens when you order the Pork & Prawn Gyoza (RM15.90). They’re perfectly pan fried where the skin has crispy edges. Inside, you will discover a juicy pork filling and a whole prawn. It’s not often you see a whole prawn as dumplings usually are filled with chopped prawns mixed with minced pork. Both types of dumplings are served with a soy sauce dip that adds a layer of flavour. For the dumplings, each order has six pieces with prices that range from RM11.90 to RM14.90. They charge an extra RM1 for the pan fried variant.   On every table, there’s also a plate of the glorious Taiwanese Fried Rice with Shrimp and Kampung Egg (RM19.90). If it’s quiet, one can hear the high intensity of the fire, required to make this plate of fried rice. Each plump grain is distinct and intertwined with chopped spring onions and bits of the friedkampungegg. The prawns are juicy and crunchy too, making it a memorable fried rice. String Beans with Minced Pork (RM17.90) have a bright green hue, signalling exemplary wok skills. Each baby spring bean is sufficiently blistered from the heat.   You may find it slightly sweet though, which I don’t mind. Apparently, this is how the Taiwanese like it as they have a deep love for sugar, which was once produced in huge quantities back in the 18th century. And for those who prefer noodles, they serve scallion oil noodles here. Theal dentestrands are tossed in a soy sauce mix that uses scallion- or spring onion-infused oil. It may look simple but it has a light flavour that grows on you.   You can order the Noodles with Special Sauce on its own for RM6.90 or opt for the noodles paired with your choice of dumplings. This combination gives you three dumplings, making it a one-dish meal. Prices range from RM12.90 to RM15.90. At night, they serve two additional dishes, namely Spicy Pickled Cucumber and Stir Fried Green Dragon Vegetable.   And if you’re like me, a fanatic dumpling fan who keeps frozen dumplings in the freezer as emergency food, you can also buy packs of the dumplings here. They also distribute to many other supermarkets, making it a convenient purchase whenever you want to get your dumplings fix.

South China Morning Postreported that the incident occurred in Mae Sot, Tak province, near the Thai-Myanmar border, where local police received reports on November 24 of eerie cries emerging from the forest at night. The man, identified as 22-year-old Liu Chuanyi, later said through a translator, “I shouted for help once every hour to conserve my strength.” On Sunday evening, members of a passing patrol unit heard someone crying but were unsure of its source. The chief officer then shouted, and the man shouted back, so they began searching for him and called a rescue team from the Mae Sot Pitakkarn Foundation, theBangkok Postreported. They traced the sound to a dry well, where Liu was found trapped at the bottom. The rescue operation by the authorities took 30 minutes. Liu was discovered in a weakened state, suffering from a fractured left wrist, a cerebral concussion and multiple bruises, and was immediately taken to a hospital. Villagers had reportedly heard strange cries for several nights, but avoided investigating, believing the sounds to be supernatural. Authorities suspect Liu wandered into the forest and accidentally fell into the well while trying to find his way out. Officials have contacted immigration authorities to determine why Liu was near the Thai-Myanmar border. Measures are being taken to seal the well to prevent similar incidents in the future.  "

In a proposed class action filed in federal court in Los Angeles, Holly Ricketson said she bought aWickeddoll for her daughter, who then visited an adult entertainment website through the link provided by the toymaker. Ricketson said her daughter showed her hardcore photographs from the website and both were “horrified” by what they saw, suffering emotional distress. The plaintiff said she would not have bought the doll had she known of the mistake, and Mattel has not offered refunds despite recalling the dolls on November 11. Mattel declined to comment on the lawsuit, but said in a statement that sales ofWickeddolls with correct packaging have resumed in stores and online. It has expressed regret for the error. The El Segundo, California-based toymaker had intended to link purchasers to the WickedMovie.com website, not to a similarly named website for people at least 18 years old. Mattel recommends the dolls for children aged 4 and up. Yesterday’s lawsuit seeks at least US$5 million (RM22.3 million) of damages for anyone in the United States who boughtWickeddolls whose packaging included the errant link.

Eminem’s representative Dennis Dennehy confirmed her death in an email yesterday but did not provide a cause, according toThe Guardian. Nelson had been battling lung cancer. Nelson’s rocky relationship with her son, whose real name is Marshall Mathers III, became widely known through his lyrics and legal disputes. In his 2002 hitCleaning Out My Closet, Eminem rapped, “Witnessin’ your mama poppin’ prescription pills in the kitchen. B******’ that someone’s always goin’ through her purse and s***’s missin’. Goin’ through public housing systems, victim of Münchausen’s syndrome. My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn’t.” Munchausen’s syndrome, also called factitious disorder, is a mental health condition where a person pretends to be sick or injured, or deliberately makes themselves ill, to get attention, care or sympathy from others. However, the rapper was likely referring to a related disorder, Munchausen syndrome by proxy, which is a mental health condition and a form of child abuse where the caretaker of a child, most often a mother, either makes up fake symptoms or causes real symptoms to make it look like the child is sick. These disorders can also happen concurrently. Nelson filed and settled two defamation lawsuits against Eminem over his comments in magazines and on radio. In her 2008 book,My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem, she detailed his early life to counter claims made about her. Eminem referenced his mother again in his Oscar-winning songLose Yourself, famously mentioning “mom’s spaghetti.” The track, featured in the movie8 Mile, won best rap song at the 2004 Grammy Awards. The rapper has recently celebrated career milestones, including being inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2022 and winning best hip-hop act at the 2024 MTV EMAs. Last month, Eminem announced he would become a grandfather, sharing in a music video that his daughter Hailie Jade is pregnant."

The launch of its own line of foundation models marks Amazon’s latest push to strengthen its position against forerunners Microsoft, Google, Meta and OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. Until now, Amazon’s AI offerings through its AWS cloud service had largely been limited to providing access to models from other companies, including Anthropic, an AI startup it backs. Even if Google, Microsoft and OpenAI have taken the lead on AI, AWS remains the market leader in cloud computing, which is needed to power artificial intelligence tools and products. “Inside Amazon, we have about 1,000 Gen AI applications in motion, and we’ve had a bird’s-eye view of what application builders are still grappling with,” said senior vice president Rohit Prasad, who is leading the company’s AI efforts. “Our new Amazon Nova models are intended to help with these challenges,” he added. The Amazon Nova family includes six AI models handling tasks from text creation to video generation. The company says the models are at least 75 per cent cheaper than comparable offerings available on AWS servers and faster than similar models. The initial lineup includes Nova Micro for fast text processing, Nova Lite for basic multimedia tasks, and Nova Premiere, set for an early 2025 release, for complex reasoning. Supporting 200 languages, the models can be customised using customers’ proprietary data — a feature Amazon hopes will attract enterprises developing specialised AI applications. Two dedicated models target creative content: Nova Canvas for image generation and Nova Reel for video creation. Amazon emphasised built-in safety measures for the new offerings, which will be available through AWS’s Bedrock service, with usage guidelines detailing specific use cases and limitations. — AFP    "

In his lawsuit, Bhakta claimed that workers’ personal devices, including iPhones, were installed with proprietary internal software on company grounds, where the devices are “subject to search by Apple.” Apple allegedly violated California law by requiring its employees to agree to a policy allowing the company to “engage in physical, video, and electronic surveillance” of its employees,” he added. “For Apple employees, the Apple ecosystem is not a walled garden.

2024-12-04,How to spot a loan shark: Crucial warning signs every borrower must know,https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2024/12/04/how-to-spot-a-loan-shark-crucial-warning-signs-every-borrower-must-know/158209,"KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 4 — Loan sharks are now trawling cyberspace, particularly social media platforms like TikTok, making it increasingly challenging for borrowers to distinguish between licensed moneylenders and illegal operators. As of October this year, Bukit Aman Commercial Crime Investigation Department has recorded 777 cases linked to loan sharks. Even school students are being targeted. In a recent case, a 15-year-old boy from Selangor revealed he had racked up RM13,000 in debt to 12 loan sharks after responding to an advertisement on TikTok. So, how can you identify a loan shark? Here are some key warning signs to watch out for: Legal moneylenders must be licensed and display their licences at their business premises. Under the Moneylenders Act 1951, moneylenders are required to apply for a licence from the Registrar of Moneylenders. This licence, unless revoked earlier, is valid for two years, and moneylenders must apply for renewal at least 60 days before it expires. Unlicensed moneylenders can face fines ranging from RM250,000 to RM1 million, imprisonment for up to five years, or both. Repeat offenders may also be subject to corporal punishment in addition to the penalties mentioned. The Act also mandates that licensed moneylenders must display their original licence at their business premises at all times. Failure to do so can result in a fine of up to RM10,000, a jail term of up to six months, or both. Borrowers have the right to request to see the moneylender’s licence to ensure they are dealing with a legitimate, licensed moneylender rather than a loan shark. Borrowers must obtain a duly stamped copy of the agreement Section 16 of the Moneylenders Act requires that the moneylending agreement be signed by all parties and duly stamped before a copy is provided to the borrower. If this requirement is not met, the agreement is deemed unenforceable, and the moneylender may face a fine of up to RM10,000, imprisonment for up to 12 months, or both. This is often the most glaring omission in loan shark arrangements. Victims are typically asked to sign an agreement but are not given a copy of it. Reasonable versus excessive interest rates Loan sharks typically charge exorbitant interest rates, which can range from 10 to 20 per cent per week. However, Section 17A(1) of the Act states that the interest rate for a secured loan (one backed by collateral) cannot exceed 12 per cent per annum, while the interest rate for an unsecured loan (without collateral) cannot exceed 18 per cent per annum. Any interest rates exceeding these limits render the moneylending agreement void and unenforceable. Strictly no house or workplace visits Loan sharks are notorious for intimidating defaulters by throwing red paint at their houses or workplaces. They may also resort to shaming tactics, such as posting pictures of defaulters in their neighbourhoods, claiming they owe money to loan sharks. However, Section 29(B) of the Act strictly prohibits moneylenders or their representatives from visiting or monitoring a borrower’s home or workplace. A moneylender found guilty of this offence can be fined between RM50,000 and RM250,000, or jailed for up to three years, or both. Representatives of the moneylender who are found guilty can face fines ranging from RM10,000 to RM50,000, imprisonment for up to two years, or both. If the harassment causes harm to another person, the offender may also face up to two years of imprisonment and whipping under the Act.   "
2024-12-04,"A before C? The real reason why Arsenal is above Chelsea in Premier League table, despite their identical records",https://www.malaymail.com/news/sports/2024/12/03/a-before-c-the-real-reason-why-arsenal-is-above-chelsea-in-premier-league-table-despite-their-identical-records/158761,"LONDON, Dec 3 – After 13 matches into the 2024/25 Premier League season, Arsenal and Chelsea share identical match records — but the Gunners sit second while its blue London rivals are in third. Both clubs have 25 points, with seven wins, four draws, and two losses. They have also scored 26 goals and conceded 14. According to Premier League rules, this should mean the teams occupy the same position. So why is Arsenal above Chelsea? To put it simply: Asexplainedby the Premier League, Rule C.7 of the Premier League Handbook states that: “If any two or more Clubs have scored the same number of points, have the same Goal Difference and have scored the same number of goals in League Matches in the Competition during that Season, they shall be deemed to occupy the same position in the League Table”. However, it said that “as with the Premier League table at the start of the season, where all teams have zero matches played, zero points, zero goals scored or conceded, the 20 teams have to be organised in the table through some process and alphabetical order is used”. This explains why Arsenal are ranked above Chelsea. Historically, Arsenal also started the season at the top due to its name, a practice dating back to its decision to change from “The Arsenal” in 1914 (it was previously known as Woolwich Arsenal). However, the situation will be different at the end of the season when final standings are determined — affecting titles, European qualifications, and relegations. Alphabetical order plays no role in this process. Rule C.17 explains that ties are first broken by head-to-head records, followed by away goals in those matches. If teams remain tied, a playoff at a neutral venue is held. Given the current tight standings — with only seven points separating second from 13th — will this season see the league’s first playoff? For now, Arsenal’s historical decision to simplify their name continues to work in their favour, even in the small quirks of the Premier League rankings."
2024-12-04,Who are the former jihadists now holding Syria’s Aleppo? Inside the evolution of HTS,https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/03/who-are-the-former-jihadists-now-holding-syrias-aleppoinside-the-evolution-of-hts/158777,"PARIS, Dec 4 — The Syrian rebel group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which seized Aleppo in a shock offensive over the weekend, is an Islamist movement that has long ruled swathes of the country’s northwest. The group has sought to moderate its image in recent years, including by cutting ties with its one-time sponsor Al-Qaeda, but it faces an uphill battle convincing Western governments it has fully renounced hardline jihadism, experts say. Aleppo had been held by Syrian government forces since late 2016. HTS says it no longer has any links to Al-Qaeda after severing them in 2016, five years into Syria’s civil war. It took on its current name the following year, arresting Al-Qaeda and Islamic State group jihadists, according to the International Crisis Group (ICG) think tank. But it remains blacklisted by the United States and the European Union. In large parts of the northwestern Idlib province it has controlled since 2019, it has set up a so-called “salvation government” that controls the rebel stronghold’s economy and whose judges are largely loyal to HTS. “Throughout parts of northwestern Syria, the rebels have started setting up and building upon already established proto-governance structures, indicating their ambition to govern and maintain control,” wrote the New-York-based Soufan Center. “Some of these efforts date back years, with sophisticated attempts to subsidise the cost of food and stabilise the banking and energy sectors in the areas under HTS control.” ‘Insurgent group’ Jerome Drevon, a jihadism expert at ICG, said HTS “provides basic services to the population”, coordinating with US aid agencies helping to funnel humanitarian aid to the millions in need in territories it holds. Even if some view it as authoritarian, “it provides homogeneous governance, which contrasts with other regions in Syria”, he told AFP. French journalist Wassim Nasr met HTS leader Abu Mohammed al-Jolani last year. “He and his group are no longer committed to whatever is meant by international jihad, that was crystal clear. They consider that it ‘only brought destruction and failure to their communities’,” he told a publication of the Combating Terrorism Centre linked to US military academy West Point. “Women go to school, women drive, you see people smoking in the street. Of course, they far from espouse democratic values or those of a liberal free society, but it’s a shift.” Drevon said that, whatever the reasons for HTS breaking ties with Al-Qaeda years ago — whether it was tactical to avoid unwanted US attention or not — “now it behaves like an insurgent group” with domestic aims, without any “dimension of international terrorism”.   ‘Incredibly opportunistic’ Several experts, however, warned the group has not fundamentally broken with its past despite its rebranding. Tammy Lynn Palacios, of the New Lines Institute, said HTS “has demonstrated that it is incredibly opportunistic in its allegiances and associations”. It “remains a jihadist organisation until HTS leadership successfully omits connections of its rank and file with more hardline jihadist groups and individuals”, she told AFP. “Al-Qaeda is not done with HTS, no matter how much HTS is done with al-Qaeda and thus nothing short of public and formal disavowal of al-Qaeda will truly lessen the threat of jihadist extremism in northwest Syria,” she added. The Soufan Centre also points out that “while there are signs that minorities and non-Sunnis will be respected by even extreme elements of the rebels such as HTS, terrorist organisations’ participation in the offensive causes some alarm”. Like the Taliban in power in Afghanistan since 2021 but not recognised in the West, HTS will likely struggle to leave Western “terrorist” lists. Hans-Jakob Schindler, the director of the Counter Extremism Project (CEP), said this was justified. “If you have to ask for permission before you break ties with al-Qaeda, from the leadership of Al-Qaeda, the sincerity of the ideological reorientation is in question,” he told AFP. He pointed to the case of a young Austrian man who Munich police shot dead in September after he opened fire at the Israeli consulate in the German city. Investigators last year found three videos he had recorded in 2021, showing scenes from a computer game “with Islamist content”, according to Austrian prosecutors. In one of them, the suspect had used an avatar with a flag of the “al-Nusra Front”, the name of HTS before it severed ties with Al-Qaeda in 2016. “There is absolutely no debate about the fact that they should remain listed as a terrorist group,” Schindler said. — AFP  "
2024-12-04,"Three key takeaways from a chaotic Qatar Grand Prix: Verstappen’s revenge, Hamilton’s farewell woes, and FIA turmoil",https://www.malaymail.com/news/sports/2024/12/03/three-key-takeaways-from-a-chaotic-qatar-grand-prix-verstappens-revenge-hamiltons-farewell-woes-and-fia-turmoil/158765,"DOHA, Dec 3 — Max Verstappen added gloss to his status and reputation but left a trail of argument, chaos and tension behind him in the wake of his commanding triumph at the Lusail International Circuit. As the Formula One circus decamps 600km for this week’s season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, after an exhausting run-in to an unprecedented 24-race season, it was clear that Verstappen’s fall-out with George Russell was just one of many issues that surfaced. Here, AFP Sport looks at three things we learned from Sunday’s Qatar Grand Prix: Verstappen motivated by sense of injustice The newly-crowned four-time world champion is a supreme competitor who needs no provocation, but revealed in his driving and post-race revelations that when riled by a sense of injustice he is a formidable force. His ninth win of the season owed much to Red Bull’s brilliance in revising the set-up of his car, but even more to his determination to avenge his overnight loss of pole position following rival Russell’s interventions. The Mercedes driver’s complaint about Verstappen’s slow cooldown lap in Q3 and his behaviour in the stewards’ room resulted in a ruptured relationship, loss of respect and a fierce antipathy. The pair had clashed on Saturday and did again on Sunday morning during the drivers’ pre-race show lap on a trailer when harsh words were exchanged. “He was annoyed with George,” said Red Bull boss Christian Horner. “He carried it into the race. He was super-motivated.” Verstappen’s combination of polished race-craft, natural talent and raw aggressive speed and competitiveness made him unbeatable. He said that he had “completely lost all respect for” Russell and accused the Briton of being “very nice here, in front of the camera, but then when you’re with him inside, as a person, it’s just a different person. And I can’t stand that”. In this mood, he will be a force again in Abu Dhabi where the scrap for the constructors’ championship will be decided with McLaren, hit by a penalty in Doha, leading Ferrari by 21 points. Hamilton not expecting glorious end to Mercedes era Lewis Hamilton endured another grim weekend and made clear he is not expecting a happy ending to his title-laden time with Mercedes. The seven-time champion, who won six of his titles with Mercedes, joins Ferrari next year. On Sunday, he made a false start, picked up a puncture and was penalised for speeding in the pitlane on his way to finishing 12th after the team had persuaded him to continue and not to retire his car. “It could have been worse... I finished. And it is over. It was my fault at the start. The puncture was unfortunate and speeding in the pit lane, that was me there, too. “I don’t think we’re going to end on a high. I think... it will end. What is important is that we turn up, we give it our best shot. “I am grateful I’m still standing. I’m ok. I’ve had great races and bad races in my life... not too many bad ones.” Many may focus on the irony in Hamilton’s subdued return to Abu Dhabi where, in 2021, he missed out on taking an unprecedented eighth drivers’ title in highly controversial circumstances.   Turmoil at ruling body reflected in chaotic race, penalties and unrest The ongoing turmoil at the International Motoring Federation (FIA), where widespread staff upheavals resulted in Rui Marques making his debut as race director, was reflected in a list of severe penalties and curious decisions that created a chaotic race. Most controversial was a 10-second stop-go penalty given to Lando Norris, ruining his chance of an important victory, which led to McLaren requesting a review and much wider criticism. Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff lambasted the FIA, saying: “It could have its own reality show of what’s happening... All our stakeholders need to bear in mind that we need to protect this sport and do it with responsibility, accountability and transparency — and it does not come across like that.” More discordant meetings may add to the rumbling sense of unrest among all involved as the season heads to a climax. — AFP  "

The couple fled Singapore in 2005 during investigations into Ng’s alleged misuse of electronic scrap from his company, Citiraya Industries, which defrauded clients of over US$51 million (RM228 million). Ng, the former CEO of Citiraya, allegedly orchestrated a scheme to divert shipments of electronic scrap meant for recycling, selling the materials as new products through syndicates in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Investigations by Singapore’s Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) revealed he misappropriated 89 tonnes of scrap and paid nearly S$2 million in bribes to employees and associates. Ng’s wife was also implicated in the operation, which came to light in December 2004 when Taiwanese authorities intercepted a chip marked for destruction. Authorities have since prosecuted 12 individuals, handing down sentences ranging from eight months to eight years. The couple evaded capture by assuming false identities, despite extensive efforts that included warrants, Interpol Red Notices, and seizure of assets totalling S$23 million, including luxury properties. The CPIB confirmed this as the largest asset seizure against an individual on record. According toThe Straits Times, Ng and Thor were apprehended in Johor Baru by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) and extradited to Singapore the same day. CPIB director of investigations Vincent Lim lauded the collaboration with MACC, telling the paper: “The successful arrest... attests to the longstanding ties and close cooperation between CPIB and MACC.” “There is zero tolerance and no safe haven for those who choose to break our laws... CPIB will spare no effort to track them down wherever they may hide and bring them to face justice in Singapore.” Ng will face charges of criminal breach of trust, while Thor is charged under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes Act. Both will appear in court today."
2024-12-04,Bail setback for fugitive Singapore lawyer Charles Yeo ahead of May 2025 UK extradition hearing,https://www.malaymail.com/news/singapore/2024/12/04/bail-setback-for-fugitive-singapore-lawyer-charles-yeo-ahead-of-may-2025-uk-extradition-hearing/158841,"LONDON, Dec 4 — The extradition request for fugitive Singaporean lawyer Charles Yeo will be heard in May 2025, following an initial court hearing in London yesterday, According to Channel News Asia (CNA), Yeo, 34, appeared at Westminster Magistrate’s Court, speaking only to confirm his name and date of birth while remaining behind a screen. The UK’s Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that Singapore authorities want him extradited over charges related to the abetment of cheating. According to a statement from Singapore’s Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) and Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on November 13, the request stems from allegations that Yeo was involved in the release of funds to his law firm, purportedly as part of a settlement sum in a client’s claim. UK court documents indicate the incident occurred between July 29 and November 30, 2020, the CNA report added. Yeo was arrested by UK authorities on November 4 and has been held in custody ever since. Despite being granted conditional bail for £75,000 (RM424,253) in November, his release has been delayed due to complications in verifying whether the UK Home Office still holds his passport. As an alternative to confirming his passport’s location, Yeo’s legal team had also attempted to cancel the passport at the Singapore High Commission in London. However, by yesterday’s hearing, they had yet to receive confirmation of the cancellation. The judge noted that confirmation from Singaporean authorities that the passport had been cancelled would satisfy the bail condition. “It seems to me you’ll have to wait until the Singapore authorities have that opportunity,” he remarked. Another hearing is scheduled for December 10, by which time Yeo’s legal team hopes to receive confirmation of the passport cancellation. If granted bail, Yeo will be subject to electronic monitoring, a strict curfew, and regular reporting to a police station while awaiting the full extradition hearing next year."

But I just took a test to be sure. Turns out, I’ve finally succumbed to Covid after all these years!” he wrote. Despite the diagnosis, Wong reassured the public that he was “feeling fine overall” and would self-isolate while working from home.  His recent travels included visits to Bangkok, where he was invited by Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, as well as participation in the Apec summit in Peru and the G20 summit in Brazil.

The pre-school, located at the Calvary Baptist Church branch, is operated by Anglican Preschool Services (APS). Four of the hospitalised children have since been discharged, while the remaining three are in stable condition, according to a joint statement from the Singapore Food Agency (SFA), the Ministry of Health (MOH), and the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) sent toThe Straits Timesyesterday. APS confirmed that three of the children were diagnosed with salmonella infection. Salmonella, a common cause of foodborne illnesses, can spread through contaminated food such as raw meat, eggs, and poultry, leading to symptoms like diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, and fever. In response to the outbreak, the pre-school has implemented several precautions, including suspending all group activities, keeping children in their classrooms, increasing cleaning and disinfection efforts, and temporarily closing its kitchen in favour of catered food. The Straits Timesreports that the exact timing of the first case in this cluster remains unclear. This follows a similar incident in January 2024, when eight children at Haven Infant & Toddler Centre Tanjong Pagar experienced gastroenteritis symptoms, which were believed to have been caused by a viral infection. Little Seeds, which caters to children aged 18 months to six years, operates 16 branches across Singapore."

Exxon operates 59 petrol stations in Singapore under its Esso brand, according to Esso’s website. A sale would allow Exxon to raise cash to deploy in other areas of higher growth potential, the report said, adding that players in the energy industry and investment funds had shown preliminary interest in the disposal. Exxon declined to comment on the report. The company has been operating in Singapore for more than 130 years. Its facilities in the country include a refining complex, a lubricant plant, a fuels terminal and a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) bottling plant. A potential deal would become the oil major’s second divestiture in South-east Asia in recent months. Reuters reported in July that Exxon had agreed to sell its Malaysian oil and gas assets to state energy firm Petronas, exiting the country’s upstream sector where it used to be a dominant producer. — Reuters "

The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)said, opens new tab JPMorgan’s relationship managers provided inaccurate or incomplete information to clients in 24 instances of over-the-counter bond transactions, charging them spreads above the agreed rates. MAS said in a statement that JPMorgan Chase did not have adequate processes and controls to ensure that relationship managers adhered to pre-agreed spreads with clients. The central bank said the bank had admitted liability for its failure to prevent or detect the misconduct and had paid MAS the civil penalty. “The bank has refunded the overcharged fees to affected clients. The bank has also enhanced its pricing frameworks and internal controls to prevent the recurrence of such misconduct,” MAS said. JPMorgan Chase said in a statement it was pleased the matter had been resolved and that it “represents a very small portion of the total trades processed during the related period”. “In 2020, after completing our internal review, JPMorgan Private Bank undertook a comprehensive update to its internal controls, monitoring and training framework to ensure our trade governance, pricing transparency and compliance principles continue to be upheld,” the US lender said.

2024-12-04,Singapore court denies anti-vaxxer Iris Koh’s attempt to have ex-NMP Calvin Cheng remove allegedly defamatory Facebook post,https://www.malaymail.com/news/singapore/2024/12/04/singapore-court-denies-anti-vaxxer-iris-kohs-attempt-to-have-ex-nmp-calvin-cheng-remove-allegedly-defamatory-facebook-post/158829,"SINGAPORE, Dec 4 — A district court in Singapore yesterday rejected an application from Iris Koh, founder of the anti-Covid-19 vaccination group Healing the Divide, and her husband Raymond Ng, to compel former Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) Calvin Cheng to remove an allegedly defamatory Facebook post. The post, which was published on June 21, is central to an ongoing civil defamation suit that Koh, Ng, and three other individuals have filed against Cheng. The other claimants include former Progress Singapore Party politician Bradley Bowyer, Bevan Tey, and Chan Swee Cheong. Channel News Asia (CNA) reported that District Judge Chiah Kok Khun dismissed the application, which had sought to force Cheng to remove and set to private all social media comments that allegedly suggested the claimants were responsible for “killing people.” The claimants had also requested an order preventing Cheng from making further defamatory statements. The court also ruled in Cheng’s favour, granting his request to strike out three of the claimants — Ng, Tey, and Chan — from the suit, stating that their claims were an abuse of the legal process as there was no reference to them in the original post and they lacked legal standing to participate. “There is no reference to them in the Facebook post, and they have no legal standing to be part of the suit,” the judge said. Koh and Ng expressed disappointment with the court’s decision, telling CNA that they had not yet reviewed the judge’s full reasoning but would consider an appeal after doing so. “We are disappointed with the outcome,” Koh and Ng said in response to the ruling. Cheng, in response to the ruling, highlighted his success on social media and indicated that he would pursue the costs awarded to him. “I intend to pursue the costs awarded to me to the fullest,” Cheng wrote in a Facebook post. The defamation suit against Cheng continues, with Koh and Bowyer remaining as the main claimants. Koh, who faces separate criminal charges related to her anti-vaccine activities, including deceiving the Singapore Health Ministry and instigating harassment of doctors, and Ng have argued that Cheng’s Facebook post falsely implied they had malicious intent to cause death, likening their actions to criminal acts of harm. “The post portrayed us as malevolent and dangerous individuals with criminal intent to harm others,” Koh and Ng argued. They contend the post severely damaged their reputations, led to public condemnation, and could have professional consequences. Koh and Bowyer, both named in the June 21 post, are seeking damages of S$100,000 (RM447,000) each, claiming harm to their reputations and emotional well-being. The remaining three claimants are seeking unspecified damages. In addition to damages, the claimants have asked for a public apology and retraction of the statements made in Cheng’s post. The case remains ongoing in the courts."

Now I have yet more tests to do, including a PET scan, to figure out just how far my cancer has progressed and how I should proceed treatment-wise. Am I terrified? Of course I am. Fear has never really stopped me from doing things (except maybe from visiting possibly haunted malls) because the more afraid I am of doing something, the more I push myself to move forward. Otherwise, I’d probably still be afraid of sleeping in the dark. The nice thing about getting cancer in my 40s is I’m past caring about things like losing a breast. A mastectomy is unfortunately unavoidable in my case and my doctor asked if I wanted a reconstruction. No thank you, I said. I’m thinking long-term; I don’t want it to be difficult to detect the cancer if it returns, and after 45 years of having a decent rack, I will just say thank you and goodbye, I will not miss having F cups. While I was calm in the waiting room and getting the news from my doctor, having to text people about the news made me cry. I so desperately wanted to give them good news. Still, I also felt better sharing the weight of it all because carrying it all myself is something I know I cannot bear. It’s something no one should bear alone. If life is a story, cancer is but a scary chapter of mine, and I’m just going to keep turning the pages and be grateful that friends and family have been wonderfully supportive throughout.

2024-12-04,Abolishing exams to reduce student stress?,https://www.malaymail.com/news/opinion/2024/12/02/abolishing-exams-to-reduce-student-stress/158623,"DECEMBER 2 –– The recent explanation from the government that some primary and secondary school exams, namely the UPSR and PTS, will remain abolished in order to reduce students’ stress is, as no doubt many educators will tell you, not ideal.  Sure, the move may curtail some anxiety. Sure, the refocused emphasis on inquiries, exploration, experience, contextual study etc will surely open more minds. And sure the country will save a lot more paper as a whole (smile). But ultimately, I’m not convinced this is the best way forward. Because unless students never have to sit foranyexams whatsoever in their lifetime, this strikes me as simply delaying the inevitable. I also think that exams, despite all their superficiality and questionable recall value, remain a sort of “baseline” that every student should experience.   Not unlike how learning one’s scales and arpeggios is necessary if for no other reason that one has undergone something that generations before have (again, yes, it’s controversial, but we should always think twice before chucking away something that’s been around for centuries). Nevertheless, I think the biggest issue isn’t the existence of examsper se, it’s our attitude towards academic learning and “success in life” as a whole. If students were taught to love their subjects and enjoy learning as a whole, the assessment method itself will be (almost) secondary. It’s ironic that even in cases where “group learning” or “active learning” is present, students may still feel hyper-pressured to succeed because academia remains a locus of “status achievement” as opposed to learning fulfilment. So, as I see it, the first problem is this mindset where academic competitiveness meets young adult social ranking,where the school is seen as a place to obtain prestige and standing in the (teenage) world. That’s the #1 source of pressure, NOT which question will come out in the Physics exam. Deal with this obsession with “standing out”, address this fear of being “seen as a failure” and voila students won’t have to worry about exams any more than being the last one to finish reading Harry Potter. Having said that, by all means let’s give credit where credit is due. For the Education Ministry to put more attention to non-rote methods of teaching and learning is certainly a plus. If nothing else it opens up students to more diverse ways of understanding and grappling with subjects. Hopefully such approaches will also communicate the joy of discussion, discovery, design and what-not. So perhaps there should be some rethinking on both sides. The Ministry needs to understand that exams aren’t the problem and parents need to see that they also aren’t the solution. Likewise, we can celebrate the fresh moves from the ministry without necessarily endorsing everything they do. Finally, for the sake of our children, we should absolutely remind them that their report card –– regardless of which assessment method or pedagogical approach was used to obtain the marks –– is by far NOT the most important thing in the world. * This is the personal opinion of the columnist.

2024-12-04,‘Gladiator II’ and ‘Death Whisperer 2’: A tale of two sequels,https://www.malaymail.com/news/opinion/2024/12/01/gladiator-ii-and-death-whisperer-2-a-tale-of-two-sequels/158521,"DEC 1 — There are many ways one can enjoy sequels, prequels and franchise films. The most obvious way is to be tuned in to the larger narrative involving the films, which will enable you to catch the many acts of fan service that the filmmakers will usually cram into the film, making it an even more enjoyable experience, especially when compared to the one you’d get walking into the film with no prior knowledge of such things. There are also those with a more cynical point of view who see all this as nothing more than just another cash grab by the Hollywood studios, enjoying the act of identifying and pointing out the by-the-numbers plotting, lazy writing, sometimes hilariously phoned-In performances and often disinterested direction that usually plague these movies. It’s almost as if the studios knew that people will flock to see these movies anyway, regardless of their quality, so there really is no need to try so hard to make a good movie. It’s just my luck that two sequels — one a long-awaited sequel from Hollywood and the other a very quickly assembled sequel to a big Thai hit last year — opened within a week of each other in Malaysian cinemas recently, which gave me a chance to see if there’s a case to be made on how to make, and how not to make a sequel. Gladiator II Twenty-four years on from the Oscar-winning original film, in which the hero died a heroic death, who knew that Hollywood had it in them to conjure up a sequel? I’m sure that back then, when we saw how Gladiator ended, all of us would’ve had the same thought in our minds – that’s that then. Still, Ridley Scott had thought it wise to deliver to us a legacy sequel with Gladiator II, which now focuses on a character named Lucius Verus (a shockingly charismatic Paul Mescal, especially after what we saw of him inAftersun), who is revealed to be the son of Maximus (Russell Crowe’s character in the original film), and who is hellbent on revenge against Roman General Marcus Acacius (Pedro Pascal), who he blames for the death of his wife during the film’s opening action set-piece. After his army lost the battle in that opening scene, Lucius was captured and enslaved and eventually ends up becoming a gladiator for Macrinus (Denzel Washington chewing up every bit of scenery he’s in and stealing the whole damn picture in the process). It’s a nice enough setup, but for whatever reasons known only to Scott and writer David Scarpa,Gladiator IIrepeats so many of the plot points of the original film that you’ll start to question whether this is actually a disguised and glorified remake instead of the legacy sequel that is poses to be. The acts of fan service here are so blatant, that the film even resorts to using footage from the original film, a lot! It still answers one question, “Are you not entertained,” famously asked in the original film, in the affirmative. I’m just not sure if that’s enough reason to make a sequel. Death Whisperer 2 WhileGladiator IIdefinitely makes a strong case for being another Hollywood cash grab, it’s quite hilarious that it took another obvious cash grab, but this time from Thailand, to show us how to properly make one. The originalDeath Whisperermade THB502 million (RM65 million) from a THB20 million budget in 2023, so of course a sequel would make total sense business-wise. It’s just quite shocking that a sequel arrived just a year later, and even more shocking that it has so far collected THB800 million in Thailand, overtaking the year’s breakout hitHow To Make Millions Before Grandma Dies, making it the highest grossing Thai film of 2024 so far. How did this happen? For once, director Taweewat Wantha made the bold decision not to repeat the formula and shenanigans of the first film. The characters and main ghost are still the same, so we get the same good-looking family and siblings all with names that begin with the letter “Y” like Yak, Yod, Yad and Yos, all a little bit older a year after the tragic events of the first film, which killed their middle sister Yam, who was possessed by a ghost named Tee Yod. The hunky Yak (Nadech Kugirniya from The Con-Heartist) has always suspected that Tee Yod would return to haunt their family, and has been on a ghost hunting expedition to get rid of Tee Yod once and for all, taking him and returning character Sarge Paphan into a demon/ghoul forest named Dong Khomot, which makes this part of the film kind of like something resembling the brutal action of Predator, but with ghouls and demons instead of aliens. Happening concurrently is the impending marriage of their oldest sister Yad at a hotel, which makes this part of the film something likeThe Shining, but with Thai ghosts and lore. It’s such a refreshing approach to making a sequel, that even if it’s a bit derivative in terms of inspiration, the way it’s all mashed up together to make it local and unmistakably Thai is what makes it such an entertaining watch, which is probably why people have been flocking to see it. If the filmmakers keep going like this, I definitely wouldn’t mind aDeath Whisperer 3next year as well! * This is the personal opinion of the columnist.  "
2024-12-04,Over clever workers: Malaysia’s grad job wobble,https://www.malaymail.com/news/opinion/2024/11/28/over-clever-workers-malaysias-grad-job-wobble/158238,"NOVEMBER 28 — About two million Malaysiansare employed below theirqualifiedstation. According to the department of statistics earlier this month. Underemployed, overeducated, disrespected or not given their worth. Various ways to call it. Whichever way referred to they constitute 37 per cent — more than a third — of the tertiary educated employed in the Malaysian economy. Like the digital animation graduate working for a small print shop in Kluang, helping elderly aunts choose fonts for their daughters and sons’kenduriinvitation cards. It’s soul-crushing to spend years trained in advanced animation software, termed promising by instructors, and then end up in the back of a sub-rented office unit in a derelict shop-lot block. Designing invites for Nornizran and Dayang’s wedding, while daydreaming about an alternate universe where this savant leads a team to produce Malaysia animation movie. There is nothing to be ashamed about work, regardless of pay, title or advancement. Being employed is a world better than being unemployed.   Yet to feel underutilised or underpaid is not a feeling which goes away easily. A feeling shared by far too many in Malaysia currently. To stay in class longer, only to earn less than earlier quitters because they clocked work years punches ambition in the gut. Apparently, a PhD is less valuable than five years on a work-floor. Or the graduated museum curator moonlighting too long as a club bouncer. That the only art he has left is to tell fake IDs. Every year the trained candidate is kept away from his career job, by the year, the training and qualification degrades, eventually to irrelevance. Are there answers to this predicament? It’s not local and it’s not going away It’s important to recognise Malaysia is not the lone country with this affliction. All countries which successfully invest in public education, target more graduates and facilitate state loans end up with more outputs regardless of whether the economy grows parallelly to absorb them. The United Kingdom’s Office for National Statistics reported 31 per cent of employees were overeducated for their jobs in 2017, swerving up from 20 per cent in 1992. It’s only likely the needle has trudged in the same direction in 2024. The victims are usually from the arts and humanities. The politicians suggest there are quick fixes, when there are none present. In Malaysia, it is about TVET retraining as a means to employment. But perhaps the more obvious answer. Supply has overwhelmed. The grass is greener India had a far more direct even if organic solution since the 70s and 80s. Leave the country. If the desired jobs are not prevalent even if the training for the said job is abundantly available, then the reasonable course of action is to thank the alma mater post-graduation and head abroad. To the United States and other developed countries, they went. Most thrived as technology workers at a time technologies bloomed. Today, America’s richest community is South Asians and they set roots only in the last fifty years. Cynically, in the trio of purpose, money can eclipse the need to be recognised or utilised as per training. For several decades, thousands of Filipino doctors migrated to the United States to become nurses. Due to the pay package. While Filipino doctors in their home country earn on average below US$1,000 (RM4,440) per month, when downgraded as nurses in the United States they earn an average of US$7,000 a month. The math does the explaining. The political springboard Human Resources Minister Steven Sim countered that the underemployment numbers are overstated. While at the same time, the PTPTN fund which pays for most local studentscontemplatesending loans for courses with low repayment (below 50 per cent). Since RM32 billion is owing, PTPTN wants to cut its losses. The huge hole in the company’s finances weakens the minister’s rebuttal. Those from low-prospect degrees are part of the two million who get paid much less and therefore largely incapacitated to repay student loans. PTPTN’s remarks betray their own poor assessment of our present and future graduates’ chances to better jobs. Though, them cutting ties with poorer courses means they shut down weak institutions as those centres rely solely on PTPTN to record profits. The one good outcome from otherwise a depressing situation. Why bother? It’s a convoluted subject matter, which ends up a poisoned chalice. All parties present their excuses so that they avoid blame and walk away. It matters a lot because many also expect their education to lift them up. From the PPR government housing to the condo. This problem is set to stay, the only part to work on is how to respond. Oversupply remains, as do opportunities abroad. Reorganising one’s skills to the market especially through TVET is a viable path but not a guarantee. Since the factors shift at so many levels and frequently, the fighting chance for young people as they compete with each other for the quality jobs left or they themselves create quality jobs is to take charge. Sounds simple, and a tad bit condescending but a lot of our young wait for the opportunity to be presented to them, and flagged. And expect a degree of cajoling. Otherwise, they’d take what is convenient or easy to get. Boutique assistant, motorbike deliverer. They may be fatalist because their training never made them own the situation or their futures. Maybe the real oversell is their qualifications. They feel the paper salvages them rather than convinced they are the product, with or without the paper. A lot are resigned, but not all. The go getters and sloggers are getting on just fine. Good for the inspired but how about the two million? * This is the personal opinion of the columnist."

2024-12-04,"Weddings, wealth, and the weight of angpow — Cherish How",https://www.malaymail.com/news/what-you-think/2024/12/04/weddings-wealth-and-the-weight-of-angpow-cherish-how/158842,"DEC 4 — As the Year of the Dragon draws to a close, many of us may find ourselves on wedding guest lists. Receiving a wedding invitation often brings up important questions, like “What should I wear?” and, perhaps most crucially, “How much angpow should I give?” In this modern era, a Chinese wedding invitation often carries an implicit expectation that guests should give angpow (red packets) as monetary gifts. Such an expectation has gradually placed a financial obligation on guests. This transforms the symbolic act of angpow giving into a more economic transaction akin to ‘paying for a seat’. As social norms surrounding ‘face’ influence both wedding hosts and guests, the pressure to conform to these expectations often leads to financial strain on both sides. The concept of ‘face’ is essential to understanding this social pressure. Originating in Chinese culture, referred to as 脸 (liǎn) and 面子 (miànzi), the concept was later developed by Western sociologists and linguists, such as Erving Goffman, Penelope Brown, and Stephen Levinson. They describe ‘face’ as a person’s self-image, which includes positive face – the need to be admired, respected, and approved of, and negative face – the desire for freedom without social imposition. ‘Face’ remains a crucial aspect of Chinese culture. At Chinese wedding ceremonies, hosts often strive to enhance positive face by holding lavish banquets, while guests feel pressured to maintain face by giving angpow as a sign of respect. The social expectation has led many couples to feel obligated to host grand wedding ceremonies in upscale venues, such as hotel ballrooms or high-end restaurants. Lavish feasts featuring lobsters, abalones, shark’s fin soup, and expensive alcohol are sometimes chosen not only to celebrate but to impress guests and display social status. However, these choices come with steep costs, which often leads couples to rely heavily on the angpow contributions from guests to cover their wedding expenses. For guests, receiving an invitation to such a wedding often carries the unspoken obligation to contribute a certain rate through angpow. Although most wedding invitation cards do not specify an amount or explicitly request angpow, social norms suggest a need to give an amount that matches the perceived value of the event. If a wedding banquet is held at a five- star hotel, for example, there is often an unspoken obligation to give an amount that reflects the luxury of the venue, typically far more than what some guests can afford. Traditionally, angpow giving symbolises blessings, well-wishes, and a sense of solidarity among families and friends. The monetary gift represents a shared commitment to honouring and supporting each other’s important life events. However, the focus on angpow value at weddings has now transformed this gift into something resembling a ticket to the celebration rather than a gesture of goodwill. At wedding banquets, guests commonly present angpows at an entrance registration table. Typically, they return their invitation envelope filled with money or provide a separate angpow with their names attached. This process allows hosts to track contributions, sometimes even with a list recording the amounts given. Such visibility heightens guests’ concern for their social image and can influence the amount they feel obligated to give. In one incident in 2023 in Singapore, it was reported that a bride asked guests to identify their angpows after the wedding, as some envelopes were without names. This level of scrutiny can introduce social pressure on guests to give beyond their means, partly out of a desire to ‘save face’ and meet social expectations. The pressure surrounding angpow giving was also highlighted in a recent incident in Malaysia, where a woman publicly expressed disappointment at the contributions from her wedding guests. She felt that the angpow she received was insufficient to cover the cost of her lavish wedding, particularly after one guest attended with a child and gave a contribution that she felt was too low. By sharing a breakdown of her expenses, the woman implied that guests should have contributed more. This reflects a shift from the traditional idea of angpow as a blessing to a means of financially supporting the event. The social pressure created by angpow giving is particularly challenging for individuals facing financial constraints, such as retirees and those with limited incomes. Furthermore, declining to attend a wedding or failing to give an angpow can be seen as a face-threatening act, potentially harming relationships and leading to social disharmony. As a result, many guests feel compelled to spend significantly, even if doing so imposes a financial burden on them. Ultimately, wedding ceremonies should be about honouring the union of two people and sharing joy with loved ones, rather than serving as an economic transaction. Couples can help reduce social pressure by clarifying in the wedding invitation cards that angpow giving is optional and should be within guests’ financial means. Ideally, wedding costs should reflect what the couple can afford without relying on guest contributions. In this way, angpow giving can return to its roots as a meaningful, voluntary gesture, rather than an unspoken financial obligation. Those who cannot afford the expenses of a lavish wedding ceremony should reconsider their choice and opt for a celebration within their means. If not, there is a saying in Malaysia: “If no money, don’t get married-lah!” * The author is a senior lecturer at Faculty of Languages and Linguistics, Universiti Malaya, and can be reached at[email protected] ** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail."
2024-12-04,Halt the tabling of the repressive amendments to the Communications and Multimedia Act — Wathshlah Naidu,https://www.malaymail.com/news/what-you-think/2024/12/03/halt-the-tabling-of-the-repressive-amendments-to-the-communications-and-multimedia-act-wathshlah-naidu/158793,"DECEMBER 3 — ARTICLE 19 and the Centre for Independent Journalism (CIJ) are deeply concerned by the proposed amendments to the Communications and Multimedia Act (CMA) 1998, which underwent the first reading in Parliament on 2 December 2024. As drafted, these amendments violate rights to freedom of expression and privacy, protected under international human rights law and Malaysia’s Federal Constitution. Furthermore, we are concerned about the lack of comprehensive and meaningful consultation with all stakeholders, including civil society organisations. We call for the immediate withdrawal of the amendments. ARTICLE 19 and the Centre for Independent Journalism (CIJ) find the regressive amendments are inconsistent with Article 10 of the Federal Constitution as well as Section 3(3) of the CMA, which clearly states that “nothing in the CMA shall be construed as permitting the censorship of the internet”. Instead of upholding the commitment to a free, open and interoperable internet, these amendments prioritise control over information, posing risks of censorship and suppression of dissent. We are deeply concerned that the Madani Government, under the premiership of Pakatan Harapan, is undermining its commitments under the Pakatan Harapan manifesto, to review and repeal draconian provisions of acts that restrict free speech, including the CMA. Instead, the government has introduced further rights-restricting amendments. Over the years, the government has continued to abuse and weaponise the CMA to restrict freedom of expression. The latest amendments contradict the government’s obligations under international human rights law, particularly Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which protects freedom of expression and raises even more serious questions about the government’s commitment to uphold such standards. Despite significant criticism and legal analysis from civil society organisations and political analysts on the government’s failure to proceed with institutional and human rights reforms, the Madani government seems to disregard public participation for purposes of political expediency. It is more focused on railroading through amendments that appear to control information and censor the internet. Key concerns with proposed amendments We urge the government to review the following amendments, which undermine good governance and accountability and violate freedom of expression: 1)    Expansion and overreach of the powers of the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) At the outset, we note that the proposed amendments would grant MCMC and the communication minister powers without oversight, enabling them to control and allow censorship. a)    Section 51: the expanded powers of MCMC to issue “written instructions” significantly broaden its original mandate by including “... any license conditions or any other conditions imposed by the Commission under this Act’. This unfettered clause would allow arbitrary powers without legislative oversight, risking arbitrary interference with freedom of expression. b)    Section 73A: grants the MCMC or its authorised officers and agents of technical advisors the power to search and seize information from service providers without safeguards, including protection of journalistic sources, violating privacy and due process rights. c)    Sections 252A and 252B: compel service providers to disclose user data undermine data protection and privacy rights. This is further compounded by the fact that the government is excluded from the scope of the Personal Data Protection Act 2010, thus removing the obligations to guarantee data protection. d)    Section 51A under the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission (Amendment) Bill 2024 -  Immunity from prosecution or other proceedings for the MCMC, any member, committee, employee, agent of the Commission, and any other person lawfully acting on behalf of the MCMC, when acting under the Act ‘in good faith’. This ouster clause, which includes a vague and arbitrary notion such as “good faith”, would enable abuse of powers and create an accountability gap for human rights violations, allowing for impunity for those public officials. Furthermore, the possibility of arbitrary investigation without access to a remedy violates due process, fair trial and access to justice rights. Note: The extension of the MCMC’s powers should also be read with the amendments under the MCMC Act. 2)    Highly disproportionate punitive measures and strengthening of investigative powers The amendments further disproportionately increase punitive measures in offences and related penalties. No rationale is provided to support the amendments for increasing sanctions, nor is there a clear justification for the quantum adopted in determining the threshold of fines and imprisonment. Examples of increase in punitive measures: (a)    Section 16 (Ministers powers to make regulation): subsection (2) – an increase of (i) fine from MYR300,000 to MYR1,000,000; (ii) imprisonment from three years to ten years; and (iii) fine for each day the offence continues after conviction from MYR1,000 to MYR100,000 per day. (b)    Section 53 (Non-compliance of a direction of MCMC): an increase of (i) fine from MYR300,000 to MYR1,000,000; (ii) imprisonment from three years to ten years; and (iii) additional fine for each day the offence continues after conviction from MYR1,000 to MYR100,000 per day. (c)    Section 211 (prohibition of provision of offensive content by content application service providers (CASP): subsection (2) – an increase (i) fine from MYR50,000 to MYR1,000,000; (ii) imprisonment from one year to ten years; and (iii) fine for each day the offence continues after conviction from MYR1,000 to MYR100,000 per day. (d)    Section 233 (improper use of network facilities): subsection (2) - an increase of (i) fine from MYR50,000 to MYR500,000; (ii) imprisonment from one year to two years; and (iii) fine for each day of the offence continues after conviction from MYR1,000 to MYR5,000 per day. The amendments further enhance investigative powers to search and seize without a warrant to any “authorised officer” in addition to the police under Section 248. However, they fail to include adequate safeguards against abuse, contravening the requirements of due process, necessity and proportionality under international law. 3)    Vague and overbroad provisions ARTICLE 19 and CIJ have long called for the repeal of Sections 211 and 233 of the CMA, as their broad scope and vague wording lead to arbitrary interpretations. The provisions also do not meet the international freedom of expression standards, especially the three-part test: legitimate aim, provided by law, legitimate aim, proportionate, and necessary. It is extremely concerning that the new proposed texts have not been amended to meet the tree-part test; on the contrary, they remain vague, overly broad in scope, and hinge upon highly subjective terms open to a broad range of interpretations despite the provided explanatory notes. a)    Section 211: The current provisions under Section 211 do not meet the legality test: None of the elements of this prohibition – “indecent”, “obscene”, “false”, “menacing”, or “offensive in character with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten or harass any person” – are defined further in the Act. Restrictions need to be precise and not open to arbitrary interpretation. b)    Section 233: equally includes expansive and vague terms such as “feeling of disgust due to lewd portrayal” (Explanation 1), “content which is profane in nature” (Explanation 2), “evil threats” (Explanation 5), “crude references (Explanation 6), and “hate speech” (Explanation 6), amongst others. We are particularly concerned by the inclusion of ‘hate speech’ under the amended provision — what constitutes “grossly offensive” fails to meet international standards of restrictions of speech and expression. We remind  the drafters  that in addition to the three-part test prescribed by Article 19 (3) ICCPR, Article 20(2) also requires that governments restrict speech that incites discrimination, hostility, violence, or international crimes. These standards establish a high threshold for circumscribing speech and an obligation to prohibit speech that leads to incitement. Thus, international law protects any form of expression or speech, even those that are profoundly offensive, shocking, and disturbing. Restrictions that do not meet the three-part test violate the right to freedom of expression. c)    The new additional provision 233A, which deals with unsolicited commercial electronic messages, appears to address spam and should not be included under restrictions on content. d)    Further, all additional amendments related to offenses against a child (subsection 3) should be addressed under the Sexual Offences against Children Act 2017 (Act 792) to ensure they are consistent with restorative justice principles and do not infringe on legitimate expression. 4)    Control of online platforms (section 230B) The introduction of a new for licensing regime for social media companies in the CMA and the imposition of strict liability on service providers for user-generated content risk incentivising the removal of content, undermining freedom of expression online. Such measures contradict the Manila Principles on Intermediary Liability. ARTICLE 19 and CIJ have highlighted and expressed severe concerns over introducing the licensing scheme. It is of utmost concern that amendments to insert a new section 46A give the Minister the power to dispense with the formalities of registration under a class license. This removes the Application Service Providers (ASP), Content Application Providers (CAP) and Network Service Providers the right to opt in to a procedure that is already grossly unnecessary and imbued with disproportionate obligations and related sanctions. ARTICLE 19 and CIJ  also notes that under international human rights law, registration requirements constitute an interference with the right to freedom of expression. As such, they too must be justified under the three-part test. 5)    Increase surveillance (section 252) The low threshold required of the Public Prosecutor to order surveillance measures if they think communications are likely to contain any information, combined with overly broad and vaguely defined offences under the Act (such as sections 211 and 233), would violate the right to privacy and enable misuse of power. Urgent Recommendations To ensure alignment with Malaysia’s human rights obligations, we urge the Madani government to: 1)    Delay the second reading of the Bill until further meaningful public and stakeholder consultations have been conducted, with all feedback made publicly available; 2)    Repeal section 233, as its provisions are redundant and offences already covered under the Penal Code. The right to freedom of expression is a cornerstone of democracy and is protected by customary international and domestic human rights law. Although Malaysia might impose limitations to protect legitimate interests such as national security and public order, such restrictions must be narrowly defined, evidence-based, and proportionate. The proposed amendments fall short of these standards and represent a concerning step backwards in protecting human rights in Malaysia. *Wathshlah Naidu is the Executive Director of CIJ ** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views ofMalay Mail."
2024-12-04,"Petronas, truly Malaysian — Hafiz Hassan",https://www.malaymail.com/news/what-you-think/2024/12/03/petronas-truly-malaysian-hafiz-hassan/158785,"DECEMBER 3 — According to Alex Procyk, Upstream Editor atOil & Gas Journal, Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd and its petroleum arrangement contractors recorded 19 exploration discoveries and two exploration-appraisal successes in Sarawak basin, North-west Sabah basin, and Malay Basin in Malaysia over the course of 2023. Thediscoveries, made from drilling 25 wells, contributed more than 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) of new resources. BOE is used to summarise the amount of energy that is equivalent to the amount of energy found in a barrel of crude oil. More than half of the discoveries alone were made in the Sarawak basin. Three discoveries were made in the North-west Sabah basin. Two other discoveries were made within the Malay basin. Petronas has also achieved outstanding successes in its exploration and appraisal activities internationally. During the first half of 2024, the national oil company has already reported success in Suriname with the Sloanea-2 appraisal well in Block 52 which was drilled in June.   According to an August 8media release, the above accomplishment has bolstered Petronas’ prospects in the basin and opens the possibility of developing a standalone Floating Liquified Natural Gas (FLNG) project at the field in the future. Petronas was “born” fifty years ago in 1974, under the authority of the Petroleum Development Act 1974 (PDA) which came into force on October 1 of that year. The preamble of the PDA states as follows: “An Act to provide for exploration and exploitation of petroleum whether onshore or offshore by a Corporation in which will be vested the entire ownership in and the exclusive rights, powers, liberties and privileges in respect of the said petroleum, and to control the carrying on of downstream activities and development relating to petroleum and its products; to provide for the establishment of a Corporation under the Companies Act 1965 [Act 125] or under the law relating to the incorporation of companies and for the powers of that Corporation; and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.” The Corporation is Petroleum Nasional Berhad or Petronas. In introducing the Petroleum Development Bill, for the second reading in Parliament, the opening remarks of the Minister of Primary Industries were as follows: “The purpose of this Bill is to provide a legislative framework for the exploration and exploitation of petroleum by a Corporation — in which will be vested the entire ownership in petroleum whether lying onshore or offshore of Malaysia.” The Minister described the Bill as “a historic piece of legislation ever to come before this House.” In discussing the policy aspects, he said: “The strategy is to increase the value of our Oil industry, and our effort would be based on an integrated approach so that all aspects of the Oil industry would be developed complementarity with each other.” The Minister disclosed to Parliament that the Federal Government had “a very long consultation with the State Governments such as Sarawak and Sabah” and said as follows: “On behalf of the Federal Government, I would like to express my gratitude to the Sarawak State Governments and Sabah for their willingness, for the sake of national interest, to cooperate with the Federal Government ... to table this Bill. I reckon that Honourable members will agree that the success of this Bill demonstrates the ability and competence of the leaders of the two states.” Guess who the Minister was. It was Haji Abdul Taib bin Mahmud who went on to become the fourth Chief Minister of Sarawak from 1981 to 2014 and affectionately referred to as the Father of Modern Sarawak. (Read about the late Abdul Taib Mahmudhere) Abdul Taib’s predecessor as Chief Minister, Haji Abdul Rahman bin Ya’kub (1970-1981), who was then also MP for Payang, was the first to rise in the ensuing debate of the Bill. Abdul Rahman said: “There is no doubt that the time has come for our country Malaysia to take one very important step that can guarantee that the exploration and exploitation of petroleum will not be dominated and controlled, but also given the highest attention by the Government. “Petroleum, which is so important to the country, should not be a matter of contention between the states in the federation, it must be considered of national interest. It is for this reason that the State Government of Sarawak and the Government of Sabah have agreed with the Federal Government that this Bill be tabled in this House.” The Bill was duly passed by Parliament. The PDA gave birth to Petronas, whose midwife was effectively the States in Malaysia. In other words, Petronas is truly Malaysian – created by Malaysians, by Malaysians, for Malaysians.

2024-12-04,AI and the new era of human trafficking — Haezreena Begum Abdul Hamid,https://www.malaymail.com/news/what-you-think/2024/12/03/ai-and-the-new-era-of-human-trafficking-haezreena-begum-abdul-hamid/158736," DEC 3 — Human trafficking is the movement of human beings mostly for forced labour, sexual exploitation, organ buying or forced criminality which impacts millions of people worldwide. With the looming growth of technology and multimedia, traffickers have increasingly turned to social media and other online platforms to locate, groom, and recruit potential victims, advertise and sell them, transfer illicit funds, and even monitor their victims. Additionally, traffickers exploit internet technologies to directly harm victims, leading to the emergence of “cyber-trafficking” —a new form of trafficking where victims are exploited through online means. Cyber-trafficking is further exacerbated by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies which allow traffickers to manipulate appearances and identities making it easier for them to evade detection and continue to exploit people. Some traffickers use AI to automate and expand their scope of operations, targeting vulnerable individuals through online platforms and social media. For example, AI-powered social media algorithms enable traffickers to reach potential victims with deceptive ads (e.g., fake job offers, romantic schemes, etc.) while maintaining anonymity. They can also use deepfake technology to create falsified images or videos of victims for online commercial sex markets and pornography. These images are often graphic, disturbing, and non-consensual. Traffickers also use deepfake images and videos to deceive victims by impersonating a prominent figure to gain their confidence and trust. This method is often used for job scams and sex trafficking. While the rise of AI has profoundly being used by criminal organisations and traffickers to sustain their network and operate sophisticatedly, it has also offered law enforcement agencies new tools to counter human trafficking. Hence, law enforcement agencies has increasingly adopted AI technologies in their quest to counter human trafficking. This is definitely a progressive step in enhancing their investigations and intercepting the modus operandi of trafficking operations. For example, AI would be able to analyse message histories shared in online chatrooms or between traffickers and buyers or traffickers and victims or investigate video footage and photos for signs of trafficking which has proven to be labour intensive and cumbersome when carried out the traditional way. With the advancement of technologies, AI can perform these tasks and reduce the strain on labour while minimising the psychological burden on law enforcers who are under intense pressure to rescue victims. However, the effectiveness of using AI for countering human trafficking remains uncertain and raises ethical and legal concerns, risking potential harms to victims of trafficking. These harms include but not limited to potential violation of data privacy and AI biases that create discriminatory outcomes. As of now, the Malaysian Parliament is yet to pass a bill to address human trafficking cases that involve explicit images created through deepfake technology, or a bill that comprehensively addresses AI-enabled human trafficking cases. Unlike the European Union who has launched its legislation for AI on 12 July 2024, namely the European Union’s Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act) which came into force on 1 August 2024, Malaysia’s anti-human trafficking laws and regulatory frameworks remains inadequate due to the rapid development of AI. Existing laws such as the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Migrant Smuggling Act 2007 (ATIPSOM), Penal Code, Child Act 1991, Sexual Offences Act 2017, Immigration Act 1959/53 focus primarily on traditional trafficking methods. The ATIPSOM and Penal Code for example, does not address anonymized trafficking operations, AI-manipulated images and identities, and the exploitation of global digital platforms. Even the Evidence Act 1950 does not accurately capture AI technology and its inventions under section 90 of the Act (which allows the admissibility of documents produced by computers, and of statements contained therein). What we can currently rely on for now is the extra-territorial nature of the EU AI Act which governs the development, deployment, supply, and use of AI systems based on the risk level of the systems. Article 2(1)(a) of the Act states that “the EU AI Act applies to providers placing on the market or putting into service AI systems or GPAI models in the EU, irrespective of whether those providers are established or located within the EU or in a third country.” In this instance, Malaysian entities may be affected, for instance, if they (with or without a physical presence in the EU) make the output of an AI system available for use in the EU. However, the EU AI Act does not apply to AI systems used for military, defence, national security, or personal use. Given the lacuna in law relating to the use of AI, it is imperative for the Malaysian government to decide on culpability, entity, and methods of prosecution when it involves AI. Who can we place the blame on if the traffickers uses chatbot, deepfake images, video or AI related technologies to deceive, coerce or abuse the vulnerability of a person? Can we then call this an “offenderless” crime or do we penalise the programmer for his/her inherent role which tantamount to a breach of natural justice. At present, laws are enforceable by and against legal persons only. Within this context, human beings, states, businesses, professional bodies, companies and corporations are legal persons and can be brought to court. Can we now consider machines themselves as legal persons? But how can we establish the intention of the robot? Could a robot claim defence currently available to people such as diminished responsibility, provocation, self-defence, necessity, mental disorder or intoxication should it begin to malfunction or make flawed decisions? At the moment, there is no recognition of robots as legal persons – so they cannot currently be held liable or culpable for any wrongdoings or harm caused to anyone. In conclusion, AI has become a double-edged sword in the context of human trafficking. While it offers traffickers new tools to expand their operations, it also empowers law enforcement with the ability to detect and dismantle trafficking networks more efficiently. AI and algorithms also has the potential to enhance various aspects of criminal justice decision-making. However, lawmakers need to update and amend the current anti-human trafficking legal frameworks to effectively counter human trafficking. New laws and regulations should focus on utilizing AI while eliminating privacy infringements and biased nature of AI. It should also include situations of “offenderless” crime in situations where it is hard to detect the traffickers. The law as it stands now lacks clarity. Therefore, it is imperative for states to not only embrace the use of AI in countering human trafficking but also address the culpability of AI when used in trafficking operations.

2024-12-04,"Taliban to bar Afghan women from health studies, deepening education and healthcare crises",https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/04/taliban-to-bar-afghan-women-from-health-studies-deepening-education-and-healthcare-crises/158852,"KABUL, Dec 4 — Senior employees at several institutions offering nursing and midwifery courses in Afghanistan on Tuesday said women would be barred from classes, following an edict by the Taliban supreme leader. Health officials met with directors of education institutes on Monday in the capital Kabul to inform them of the ruling, an official from the public health ministry who was not authorised to speak to the media told AFP. “There is no official letter but the directors of institutes were informed in a meeting that women and girls can’t study anymore in their institutes,” he said. “They were not provided with any details and justification and were just told of the order of the supreme leader and were asked to implement it.” The manager of an institute who attended the meeting and asked not to be named for fear of reprisal said dozens of managers were in attendance. A senior employee of another centre told AFP his boss had been at a separate meeting with health officials on Tuesday after confusion about the rule. The employee said institutes had been given 10 days to hold final exams. Some managers petitioned the ministry for clarity, while others carried on as normal in the absence of a written order. Not long after Taliban authorities swept back to power in 2021, they barred girls from education beyond secondary school as part of restrictions labelled “gender apartheid” by the United Nations. Women students then flocked to health institutes, one of the few avenues still open to them. They now make up the majority of students in these centres. Afghanistan has around 10 public and more than 150 private health institutes offering two-year diplomas in 18 subjects, ranging from midwifery to anaesthesia, pharmacy and dentistry, with a total of 35,000 women students, health ministry sources said. “What are we supposed to do with just 10 per cent of our students?” one manager said. Aysha — not her real name — a midwifery teacher at a private institute in Kabul, said she received a message from management telling her not to come to work until further notice with little explanation. “This is a big shock for us. Psychologically, we are shaken,” the 28-year-old said. “This was the only source of hope for the girls and women who were banned from universities.” The United Kingdom’s charge d’affaires said he was “deeply concerned” by the reports. “This is another affront to women’s right to education and will further restrict access to healthcare for Afghan women and children,” he posted on social media platform X. The health ministry source said the ban would squeeze an already suffering health sector. “We are already short of professional medical and para-medical staff and this would result in further shortages.” — AFP  "

The Chinese ship “fired a water cannon at the BRP Datu Pagbuaya, aiming directly at the vessel’s navigational antennas,” Philippine Coast Guard spokesman for the South China Sea Commodore Jay Tarriela said in a statement, adding it then “intentionally sideswiped” the ship before launching a second water cannon attack. — AFP  "
2024-12-04,"UN seeks record US$47b for 2025 as Gaza, Sudan, Ukraine conflicts and extreme weather drive 305 million into crisis",https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/04/un-seeks-record-us47b-for-2025-as-gaza-sudan-ukraine-conflicts-and-extreme-weather-drive-305-million-into-crisis/158861,"GENEVA, Dec 4 — The UN appealed Wednesday for more than US$47 billion (RM210 billion) to deliver vital aid next year, warning surging conflicts and the climate crisis will leave hundreds of millions of people in need. “The world is on fire,” the United Nations’ new humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher told reporters in Geneva, acknowledging he was looking ahead to 2025 with “dread”. With brutal conflicts spiralling in places like Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine, and as climate change and extreme weather take an ever-heavier toll, the UN estimated that 305 million people globally will need some form of emergency assistance next year. “We are dealing with a poly-crisis right now globally, and it is the most vulnerable people in the world who are paying the price,” Fletcher said, warning that swelling inequality combined with the convergence of conflict and climate change had created a “perfect storm” of needs. Launching the Global Humanitarian Overview, Fletcher acknowledged that the UN and its partners would not be able to reach all of those in need. The annual appeal by UN agencies and other humanitarian organisations is seeking US$47.4 billion for 2025 — slightly less than the appeal for this year — which it said was enough to provide assistance to the 189.5 million most vulnerable people. “There’s 115 million that we won’t be able to reach” with this plan, Fletcher acknowledged. ‘Ruthless’ Pointing to significant “donor fatigue” hitting humanitarian operations around the world, he stressed the need to lay out a “realistic” plan, which will require prioritisation and making “really tough, tough choices”. “We’ve got to be absolutely focused on reaching those in the most dire need, and really ruthless,” he said. As of last month, only 43 per cent of the US$50-billion appeal for this year had been met. Underfunding has this year seen an 80-per cent reduction in food assistance in Syria, cuts to protection services in Myanmar, and diminished water and sanitation aid in cholera-prone Yemen, the UN said. The single biggest barriers for assisting and protecting people in armed conflict, though, were the widespread violations of international law. 2024 has already been the deadliest year for humanitarian workers, surpassing last year’s toll of 280 killed. The global humanitarian system “is overstretched, it’s underfunded and it’s literally under attack”, Fletcher said. “We need a surge in global solidarity.” Fears meanwhile abound that Donald Trump’s looming return to the presidency in the United States — the world’s biggest humanitarian donor — could see aid agency budgets cut rather than raised next year. Fletcher said he planned to “spend a lot of time in Washington” in coming months to engage with the new administration. ‘Unconscionable’ The “much tougher global climate (was) not just about America”, he said, adding he planned “to bash down doors” around the world and make the argument about the need to step up. A record 123 million people were living displaced from their homes due to conflict by mid-2024, while one out of every five children globally is currently living in or fleeing conflict zones, according to UN figures. “The suffering behind the numbers is all the more unconscionable for being man-made,” Fletcher said. “Wars in Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine are marked by the ferocity and intensity of the killing, the complete disregard for international law, and the deliberate obstruction of our humanitarian movement’s effort to save lives.” Numerous old crises meanwhile remain unresolved and simmering, with average humanitarian operations now spanning a decade, the UN said. “The longer they last, the bleaker the prospects,” Fletcher warned, pointing out that “life expectancy drops, vaccination rates plummet, education suffers, maternal mortality skyrockets, and the spectre of famine grows”. Even more worryingly, he said, was how conflicts were increasingly converging with the climate-induced disasters that are ravaging communities, devastating food systems and driving mass displacement. “The dread I have is that those two huge drivers of need are now combining,” he said. — AFP  "
2024-12-04,"Hong Kong mega development plan to devour villages, wetlands",https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/04/hong-kong-mega-development-plan-to-devour-villages-wetlands/158847,"HONG KONG, Dec 4 — For almost half a century, Kwok Hoi-yin’s humble cottage on Hong Kong’s border with mainland China was surrounded by leagues of fishponds and green fields, buffering the modern highrises of megacity Shenzhen to the north. In recent years his village has shrunk, nibbled away by roads and bridges as the government claims land for crossborder infrastructure and its Northern Metropolis project, an ambitious plan to urbanise the border area that has proceeded despite concerns from locals and environmentalists. Kwok’s bucolic idyll, near the city’s largest and most important wetlands, is long gone. Instead the view from his window is a grey stone wall, while an army of mosquitoes rises from the dead water remaining under his hut. “To put it politely we are sacrificing for the greater good, but to put it less politely, we have been sliced off, piece by piece,” Kwok, 69, told AFP. His 100-year-old village, Ha Wan Tsuen, might now be wiped out entirely. In September the government approved a plan to create an enormous new tech zone that will eventually swallow it up. “We hope they won’t tear down our village—that’s our most genuine but also most impossible wish,” Kwok, who has served as Ha Wan Tsuen’s elected chief for a decade, said. “Because it’s impossible for us to resist the government—it would be like a praying mantis trying to stop a chariot.” 90 per cent opposition Commonly known as the San Tin Technopole, the planned tech zone is the cherry on top of the Northern Metropolis. It will be the “core of industry development”, according to the government, providing a third of the Metropolis’ promised 500,000 new jobs. The wider project—which aims to deepen integration with mainland China—is set to transform 30,000 hectares of land along the border, about a third of Hong Kong’s territory. The Metropolis will house 2.5 million people, the government says. But those who already call the area home, like Kwok, had little chance to put their concerns about the development directly to the government. The last chance for ordinary people to speak out was a four-day hearing held by the Town Planning Board in the summer. A two-month consultation period before the hearing had resulted in a 90 per cent opposition rate from about 1,600 submissions—but the board still gave the project a green light. An evacuation date for Ha Wan Tsuen has not yet been set, nor has compensation. The government has also dismissed concerns over the project’s environmental impact. The Technopole will push up against a large protected wetland area, which has been UNESCO-recognised since 1995. The area around those wetlands—around 2,600 hectares of fishponds, rivers and marshes—had been designated by the Hong Kong government as a conservation and buffer zone, to limit development and preserve a complete eco-system. ‘Wetland damages’ The Technopole will take over 240 hectares of those zones, the government has admitted. “Over the past 30 years Hong Kong never had a development plan that would cause wetland damages in such a scale,” Wong Suet-mei, a conservation officer of the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society, told AFP. The government says most of the wetlands that will be affected have already changed beyond recognition. It says it will establish a wetland conservation park as “compensation”, along with other measures such as keeping a 300-metre flight path for birds. “Based on the previous experience in ecological compensation in other development projects, we are confident that the number of bird numbers will be maintained at the current level or even increase,” the Development Bureau told AFP. Chan Kwok-sun, an aquafarmer whose almost 40-year-old ponds are set to be filled in for the Technopole, remained doubtful. “No one can farm fish when the ponds are taken, no bird will come when there is no fish for them,” Chan told AFP. The 74-year-old farmer said he welcomed the government’s development plan though, as he has witnessed the rise of Shenzhen from “pure darkness like in primitive times” to “a mountain of skyscrapers”. However, he said he would stay among his ponds until the last day possible. “I live an unfettered life here,” Chan said. “It’s hard to find it elsewhere.” — AFP  "
2024-12-04,‘Grave concerns’ for trio missing on New Zealand’s tallest peak,https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/04/grave-concerns-for-trio-missing-on-new-zealands-tallest-peak/158846,"WELLINGTON, Dec 4 — Dangerous weather has halted the search for three foreign climbers missing on New Zealand’s tallest mountain, police said today, adding they had “grave concerns” for the trio. Two United States citizens and a Canadian national were reported missing Monday evening after failing to show up for a pre-arranged flight. Police said the alpine terrain of 3,700-metre Mount Cook was “difficult to navigate” and bad weather had forced them to suspend the search until at least Thursday. “Police hold grave concerns for the three men,” they said in a statement. Rescue teams had earlier found several pieces of discarded climbing gear they believed belonged to the men. The two US citizens were identified as Kurt Blair, 56, and Carlos Romero, 50. Police withheld the name of the Canadian climber “due to family wishes”. New Zealand’s official tourism body recommends that only “well-prepared, experienced mountaineers” attempt to tackle Mount Cook. “The weather can change very suddenly—be prepared for heavy rainfall, snow and/or high winds.” — AFP  "
2024-12-04,South Korea opposition says will start impeachment proceedings unless President Yoon resigns,https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/04/south-korea-opposition-says-will-start-impeachment-proceedings-unless-president-yoon-resigns/158833,"SEOUL, Dec 4 — South Korean lawmakers on Wednesday called for the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol after he declared martial law only to reverse the move hours later, triggering the biggest political crisis in decades in Asia’s fourth-largest economy. The surprise declaration late on Tuesday ignited a standoff with parliament which rejected his attempt to ban political activity and censor the media, as armed troops forced their way into the National Assembly building in Seoul. A coalition of lawmakers from opposition parties said they planned to propose a bill to impeach Yoon on Wednesday which should be voted within 72 hours. “The parliament should focus on immediately suspending the president’s business to pass an impeachment bill soonest,” Hwang Un-ha, one of the MPs in the coalition, told reporters. The leader of Yoon’s ruling People Power Party called for Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun to be fired and the entire cabinet to resign. Yoon told the nation in a TV address late on Tuesday that martial law was needed to defend the country from nuclear-armed North Korea and pro-North anti-state forces, and protect its free constitutional order, although he cited no specific threats. Chaotic scenes ensued as helmeted troops climbed into the parliament building through smashed windows and military helicopters hovered overhead. Parliamentary aides sprayed fire extinguishers to push the soldiers back, and protesters scuffled with police outside. The military said activities by parliament and political parties would be banned, and that media and publishers would be under the control of the martial law command. But within hours of the declaration, South Korea’s parliament, with 190 of its 300 members present, unanimously passed a motion requiring martial law be lifted, including all 18 members present from Yoon’s party. The president then rescinded the declaration. Protesters outside the National Assembly shouted and clapped. “We won!” they chanted, and one demonstrator banged on a drum. More protests are expected on Wednesday with South Korea’s largest union coalition, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, planning to hold a rally in Seoul and vowing to strike until Yoon resigns. The US embassy urged US citizens in South Korea to avoid areas where protests were taking place, while some major employers including Naver Corp and LG Electronics Inc advised employees to work from home. Financial markets were volatile with South Korean stocks falling around 2 per cent and the won steadying after plunging to a two-year low, as dealers reported suspected intervention by South Korean authorities to stem the won’s slide. Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok and Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong held emergency meetings overnight and the finance ministry promised to prop up markets if needed. “We will inject unlimited liquidity into stocks, bonds, short-term money market as well as forex market for the time being until they are fully normalised,” the government said in a statement. The BOK said it will start special repo operations from Wednesday for local financial institutions to support smooth market functioning. Dodged a bullet Residents of Seoul followed the developments closely on television and smartphones and discussed online, but life largely went on as usual on Wednesday. “I’m deeply disturbed by this kind of situation, and I’m very concerned about the future of the country,” 39-year-old resident Kim Byeong-In told Reuters. The main opposition Democratic Party called for Yoon, who has been in office since 2022, to resign or face impeachment over the martial law declaration, the first in South Korea since 1980. “Even if martial law is lifted, he cannot avoid treason charges. It was clearly revealed to the entire nation that President Yoon could no longer run the country normally. He should step down,” senior DP member of parliament Park Chan-dae said in a statement. The National Assembly can impeach the president if more than two-thirds of lawmakers vote for it. A trial is then held by the constitutional court, which can confirm it with a vote by six of the nine justices. Yoon’s party controls 108 seats in the 300-member legislature. If Yoon resigned or was removed from office, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo would fill in as leader until a new election was held within 60 days. “South Korea as a nation dodged a bullet, but President Yoon may have shot himself in the foot,” said Danny Russel, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute think tank in the United States. The crisis in a country that has been a democracy since the 1980s, and is a US ally and major Asian economy, caused international alarm. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he welcomed Yoon’s decision to rescind the martial law declaration. “We continue to expect political disagreements to be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law,” Blinken said in a statement. South Korea hosts around 28,500 American troops as a legacy of the 1950-1953 Korean War. Planned defence talks and joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States were postponed, the Yonhap news agency reported. Sweden’s prime minister also postponed a visit to South Korea, a spokesperson said. Yoon, a career prosecutor, squeezed out a victory in the tightest presidential election in South Korean history in 2022, riding a wave of discontent over economic policy, scandals and gender wars. But he has been unpopular, with his support ratings hovering at around 20 per cent for months. His People Power Party suffered a landslide defeat at a parliamentary election in April this year, ceding control of the unicameral assembly to opposition parties that captured nearly two-thirds of the seats. There have been more than a dozen instances of martial law being declared since South Korea was established as a republic in 1948. In 1980, a group of military officers led by Chun Doo-hwan forced then-President Choi Kyu-hah to proclaim martial law to crush calls by the opposition, labour and students for the restoration of democratic government. — Reuters   "
2024-12-04,S.Korean president abandons martial law attempt,https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/04/skorean-president-abandons-martial-law-attempt/158806,"SEOUL, Dec 4 — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol abandoned a short-lived attempt at martial law today, reversing course after lawmakers defied security forces to vote against his declaration and thousands of protesters took to the streets. Yoon’s shock bid to impose South Korea’s first martial law in over four decades plunged the country into its deepest turmoil in its modern democratic history and caught even South Korea’s closest allies around the world off guard. It also left the future of Yoon — a conservative politician and former star public prosecutor who was elected president in 2022 — in jeopardy. South Korea’s main opposition party — whose lawmakers jumped fences and tussled with security forces so they could vote to overturn the law — demanded Yoon to step down immediately over the attempted “insurrection”. The nation’s largest umbrella labour union also called an “indefinite general strike” until Yoon resigned. And the leader of Yoon’s own ruling party even described the attempt as “tragic” while calling for those involved to be held accountable. Yoon backed down after lawmakers voted to oppose the declaration, which he made late on Tuesday night citing the threat of North Korea and “anti-state forces”. “Just a moment ago, there was a demand from the National Assembly to lift the state of emergency, and we have withdrawn the military that was deployed for martial law operations,” Yoon said in a televised address around 4:30 am (5.30pm Malaysian time). “We will accept the National Assembly’s request and lift the martial law through the Cabinet meeting.” Yonhap news agency then reported that Yoon’s cabinet had approved the motion to lift the order. The U-turn prompted jubilation among protesters outside parliament who had braved freezing temperatures to keep vigil through the night in defiance of Yoon’s martial law order. Demonstrators who had been waving South Korean flags and chanting “Arrest Yoon Sul Yeol” outside the National Assembly erupted in cheers. Lim Myeong-pan, 55, told AFP that Yoon’s decision to rescind martial law did not absolve him of wrongdoing. “Yoon’s act of imposing it in the first place without legitimate cause is a serious crime in itself,” Lim told AFP. “He has paved his own path to impeachment with this.” Defying security forces, 190 lawmakers managed to get in to the assembly in the early hours of today and unanimously voted to oppose martial law. Under the constitution, martial law must be lifted when a majority in parliament demands it.   International concern Yoon had given a range of reasons to justify martial law—South Korea’s first in more than 40 years. “To safeguard a liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea’s communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements plundering people’s freedom and happiness, I hereby declare emergency martial law,” Yoon said in a televised address. Yoon did not give details of the North’s threats, but the South remains technically at war with nuclear-armed Pyongyang. “Our National Assembly has become a haven for criminals, a den of legislative dictatorship that seeks to paralyse the judicial and administrative systems and overturn our liberal democratic order,” Yoon said. The president labelled the main opposition Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the 300-member parliament, “anti-state forces intent on overthrowing the regime”. Yoon and his People Power Party are also bitterly at odds with the opposition over next year’s budget. Opposition MPs last week approved a significantly downsized budget plan through a parliamentary committee. The imposition of emergency martial law came after Yoon’s approval rating dropped to 19 percent in the latest Gallup poll last week, with many expressing dissatisfaction over his handling of the economy and controversies involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee. Concern, relief Democratic South Korea is a major ally for the United States in Asia, but Washington said it was not given advance notice of Yoon’s plan to impose martial law. The United States initially voiced “grave concern” at the declaration, then relief. “We are relieved President Yoon has reversed course on his concerning declaration of martial law and respected the ROK National Assembly’s vote to end it,” a National Security Council spokesperson said in a statement, using the acronym for South Korea’s official name. China, a key ally of North Korea, had urged its nationals in the South to stay calm and exercise caution, while Britain said it was “closely monitoring developments”. Vladimir Tikhonov, professor of Korea studies at the University of Oslo, said Yoon’s move to impose martial law was “an attempt to wind the history back”. “I don’t think South Korea’s civil society can recognise Yoon as a legitimate president any longer,” he told AFP. — AFP "
2024-12-04,S.Korea political upheaval shows global democracy's fragility — and resilience,https://www.malaymail.com/news/world/2024/12/04/skorea-political-upheaval-shows-global-democracys-fragility-and-resilience/158807,"WASHINGTON, Dec 4 — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s brief imposition of martial law marks a new warning for the worldwide fragility of democracy, even in a country hailed as a model of political transformation. Yoon’s overnight attempt to shut down political activity, censor media and lock out opposition lawmakers stunned South Korea’s longtime ally, the United States, which said it had no advance warning and issued a statement of concern. South Korea’s transition to elected rule since a mass uprising in 1987 had been seen as so thorough that the United States increasingly spoke of its ally as a global partner. Meanwhile, Seoul billed itself as a new, ideal hub for international media as China clamped down on Hong Kong. President Joe Biden had even chosen Yoon as the host in March of his final Summit for Democracy—a signature initiative of the outgoing US leader, who sought to champion liberal values globally, in an unstated repudiation of Donald Trump, who returns to the White House next month. But observers, while stunned by Yoon, said there were warning signs. Danny Russel, a top US diplomat for Asia under former president Barack Obama and who earlier served in South Korea, pointed to the deadlock in parliament where the opposition repeatedly sought impeachments against Yoon’s administration. Yoon’s move “was a complete surprise to me (but) yes, there were very obvious structural forces at work,” he said. “There is a radically polarised political scene in Korea. The opposition has been pursuing scorched-earth political obstruction tactics,” he said. But he pointed to the quick, large-scale protests that erupted after Yoon’s declaration as a sign of a vibrant civil society ready to defend democracy. “One certainly would hope that this would serve as a wake-up call to both the ruling conservative party and the progressive opposition that both sides have gone too far and that there needs to be some process of reconciliation, of dealing with legitimate differences and grievances.” Authoritarian tendencies Yoon himself had earlier shown signs of authoritarianism. In a national address last year, Yoon raged against supposed communists who have “disguised themselves as democracy activists, human rights advocates or progressive activists.” A prosecutor, Yoon narrowly won the 2022 election on a platform of economic reform and advocated close ties with the United States as well as historic rival Japan. But his popularity swiftly slid and the opposition won the National Assembly. Celeste Arrington, a Korea expert at George Washington University, noted that Yoon had never held elected office before and had become increasingly frustrated. “This is really an extreme move that may signal, I think, the president’s lack of political experience,” she said. She said that martial law showed “some cracks in democracy” but that the quick reversal “gives me hope in the health and strength and vibrancy of democracy in South Korea.” Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, expected Yoon’s career to be over after attempting martial law, which constitutionally can only be imposed for wars or other emergencies. “Yoon’s action is a damning reversal to decades of South Korean efforts to put its authoritarian past behind it,” he said. Democracy stronger? The number of democracies worldwide soared starting in the late 1980s as the Soviet Union collapsed and student-led uprisings brought reforms elsewhere. But globally, democracy has been in retreat for the last 18 straight years, according to the Washington-based group Freedom House, which promotes political liberty. Democratically elected leaders have taken increasingly authoritarian steps in countries as diverse as India, Turkey and Hungary. V-Dem, another closely watched democracy index, had most recently ranked South Korea third in Asia after Taiwan and Japan. In the United States, Trump has rejected long-held norms, refusing to accept he lost to Biden four years ago—culminating in his supporters violently rampaging through the US Capitol. Trump’s rejection of democracy ultimately worked out for him: campaigning on the rage of 2020, he won last month’s election. But experts said Yoon’s power play—and its reversal—could in fact show a victory for democratic values. “Yoon is a deeply unpopular and ineffectual leader, but there was nothing I saw of people being dissatisfied with the way government runs,” Alan Yu, a senior vice president at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said after a recent trip to Seoul. Darcie Draudt-Vejares of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that with the swift response to Yoon, “this crisis may ultimately strengthen Korean democracy by reaffirming civilian control and demonstrating institutional resilience.” — AFP  "

Anwar, when presenting the Supply Bill 2025 for its second reading in the Dewan Negara today, said that next year, the reform agenda will be implemented even more aggressively with the country's economy expected to grow strongly between 4.5 and 5.5 per cent. Among the heavyweights, Maybank, Public Bank and IHH were flat at RM10.18, RM4.51 and RM7.22, respectively. CIMB eased one sen to RM8.20 while Tenaga Nasional surged 22 sen to RM13.60. Among active counters, Zen Tech and JCY International held steady at one sen and 48.5 sen, respectively. Top Glove firmed up six sen to RM1.23, Cape EMS inched up half-a-sen to 38 sen and Reservoir Link bagged three sen to 37 sen. On the index board, the FBM Emas Index advanced 74.41 points to 12,306.62, the FBMT 100 Index climbed 70.05 points to 11,991.04 and the FBM 70 Index surged 237.06 points to 18,255.48. The FBM Emas Shariah Index rose 108.89 points to 12,308.92, while the FBM ACE Index increased 40.93 points to 5,230.57.

2024-12-04,"Asian stocks slip, rattled by South Korean political unrest",https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2024/12/04/asian-stocks-slip-rattled-by-south-korean-political-unrest/158832,"SINGAPORE, Dec 4 — Asian equities stumbled today while currencies were volatile as traders scrambled to contend with the political storm in South Korea, where martial law was imposed and subsequently lifted hours later. South Korea’s won strengthened in early trading buoyed by suspected intervention but remained close to the two-year low against the dollar it hit late yesterday. The benchmark KOSPI index was down nearly 2 per cent, taking its year-to-date losses to over 7 per cent, making it the worst performing major stock market in Asia this year. That left the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which counts Samsung Electronics as one of its top constituents, down 0.32 per cent on Wednesday. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said on Wednesday he would lift a surprise martial law declaration he had imposed just hours before, backing down in a standoff with parliament which roundly rejected his attempt to ban political activity. “Martial law itself has been lifted but this incident creates more uncertainty in the political landscape and the economy,” said Min Joo Kang, senior economist at ING. “We are concerned that these events could impact South Korea’s sovereign credit rating, although this is uncertain at this stage. However, this is a scenario that could happen.” South Korea’s finance ministry said it was prepared to deploy “unlimited” liquidity into financial markets if needed, with the Yonhap news agency saying the financial regulator was ready to deploy 10 trillion won (RM32 billion) in a stock market stabilisation fund. The finance minister holds a press conference at 0120 GMT. “A bit of uncertainty here given how the events played ... that can fuel some rush to safety. But Korean authorities appear to be moving quickly to stabilise markets, and the impact is likely to be short-lived,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo. Still, the jolt to the market from East Asia stoked further worries of uncertainties around the globe, with investors already reeling from the political turmoil in France that has weighed on the euro, which was down 0.11 per cent at US$1.04975 (RM4.70). French bond futures fell 0.13 per cent while European stock futures was 0.14 per cent lower ahead of French lawmakers’ vote on Wednesday on no-confidence motions which are all but certain to oust the fragile coalition of Prime Minister Michel Barnier. “If the government collapses, an emergency legislation will likely be adopted to avoid a government shutdown ... the spread between French and German 10-year government bond yields can further move against the euro,” said Carol Kong, currency strategist at Commonwealth Bank of Australia. On the macro side, investors are hoping for more cues to gauge the policy path the Federal Reserve will likely take next year, with much-anticipated November employment report due on Friday. US job openings increased solidly in October while layoffs dropped by the most in 1-1/2 years, data showed on Tuesday, suggesting the labour market continued to slow in an orderly fashion although another survey showed employers were hesitant to hire more workers. Markets are now ascribing a 72 per cent chance of a 25 basis point cut this month, with 80 bps of cuts expected by the end of next year. US central bankers said they continue to believe inflation is heading down to their 2 per cent target and signalled support for further rate cuts ahead, but none pushed strongly for or against doing so when they next meet to set rates in two weeks. The spotlight now turns to Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday who will give what are expected to be his last public remarks before the meeting. The dollar index, which measures the US currency against six rivals, was up 0.12 per cent at 106.45. Gold prices eased 0.17 per cent to US$2,639 on a strong dollar. Oil prices were flat after gaining more than 2 per cent in the previous session as Israel threatened to attack the Lebanese state if its truce with Hezbollah collapses, and as investors positioned for OPEC+ to announce an extension of supply cuts this week. — Reuters  "
2024-12-04,Ringgit remains lower against US dollar in early trade,https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2024/12/04/ringgit-remains-lower-against-us-dollar-in-early-trade/158825,"KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 4 — The ringgit remained lower against the US dollar in early trade today as investors remained cautious about global market developments, an analyst said. At 8.02am, the ringgit eased to 4.4650/4750 against the US dollar compared with yesterday’s close of 4.4675/4720. SPI Asset Management managing partner Stephen Innes said the ringgit might face a jittery start, but anticipated the domestic unit would largely hold steady, given Malaysia’s typically weak correlation with the South Korean won. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol backtracked on his shortlived martial law order in the early hours of today local time after declaring martial law in a surprise late-night address yesterday. He added that today’s focal point would be the China fix, especially after the offshore yuan tested the 7.30 level yesterday. “The People’s Bank of China has set the onshore Yuan fix below 7.20. Any adjustment above this could spell trouble for regional currencies. “Such a move might be seen as a bearish signal, prompting traders to offload currencies closely tied to China, like the Malaysian ringgit, amid growing unease,” he told Bernama. Bank Muamalat Malaysia Bhd chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said the US Job Opening and Labour Turnover Survey was lower than expected at 7.744 million in October against consensus estimates of 7.51 million, suggesting the labour market is softening. At the same time, there is political instability in South Korea following the swift reversal of martial law. “It is somewhat risk-off mode at the moment, suggesting that the US dollar could be in high demand as traders and investors are seeking protection against market uncertainties,” he told Bernama. The ringgit traded mostly higher against a basket of major currencies. It advanced against the British pound to 5.6589/6716 from 5.6643/6700 yesterday, improved against the euro to 4.6923/7028 from 4.7003/7050 but fell vis-a-vis the Japanese yen to 2.9844/9913 from 2.9825/9859 yesterday. The local note also traded mixed against Asean currencies. It increased against the Singapore dollar at 3.3199/3276 from yesterday’s close of 3.3223/3261 and was little changed against the Philippine peso to 7.62/7.64 from 7.62/7.63. The local unit went down against the Thai baht to 13.0023/0398 from 12.9854/13.0042 yesterday but was up against the Indonesian rupiah at 279.9/280.7 from 280.1/280.5 previously. — Bernama "
2024-12-04,Do not pass go: Elon Musk loses bid to restore US$56b Tesla pay package,https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2024/12/03/do-not-pass-go-elon-musk-loses-bid-to-restore-us56b-tesla-pay-package/158719,"WILMINGTON (Delaware), Dec 3 — A Delaware judge ruled yesterday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a US$56 billion (RM250 billion) compensation package despite shareholders of the electric vehicle company voting to reinstate it. The ruling by the judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, follows her January decision that called the pay package excessive and rescinded it, surprising investors, and cast uncertainty over Musk’s future at the world’s most valuable carmaker. Musk did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company’s driving force who is responsible for many of its advances and reinstate his compensation. McCormick said Tesla’s board was not entitled to hit “reset” to restore Musk’s pay package. “Were the court to condone the practice of allowing defeated parties to create new facts for the purpose of revising judgments, lawsuits would become interminable,” she said in her 101-page opinion. She also said Tesla made multiple material misstatements in its proxy statement regarding the vote and could not claim the vote was a “cure-all” to justify restoring Musk’s pay. “Taken together,” the problems with Tesla’s arguments “pack a powerful punch,” she wrote. Tesla shares fell 1.4 per cent in after-hours trade, after the ruling. McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the case US$345 million, well short of the US$6 billion they initially requested. She said the fee could be paid in cash or Tesla stock. “We are pleased with Chancellor McCormick’s ruling, which declined Tesla’s invitation to inject continued uncertainty into Court proceedings,” said a statement from Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, one of the three law firms for the plaintiff. The law firm also said it looked forward to defending the court’s opinion if Musk and Tesla appealed. Musk and Tesla can appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court as soon as McCormick enters a final order, which could come as soon as this week. The appeal could take a year to play out. After the January ruling, Tesla shareholders flooded the court with thousands of letters arguing that rescinding Musk’s pay increased the possibility he would leave Tesla or develop some products like artificial intelligence at ventures other than Tesla. Attorneys for shareholder Richard Tornetta, who sued in 2018 to challenge Musk’s compensation package, had argued that Delaware law does not permit a company to use a ratification vote to essentially overturn the ruling from a trial. McCormick in January found that Musk improperly controlled the 2018 board process to negotiate the pay package. The board had said that Musk deserved the package because he hit all the ambitious targets on market value, revenue and profitability. But the judge criticized Tesla’s board as “beholden” to Musk, saying the compensation plan was proposed by a board whose members had conflicts of interest due to close personal and financial ties to him. After the January ruling, Musk criticised the judge on his social media platform X and encouraged other companies to follow the lead of Tesla and reincorporate in Texas from Delaware, although it is unclear if any companies did so. The judge in her January ruling called the pay package the “biggest compensation plan ever - an unfathomable sum.” It was 33 times larger than the next biggest executive compensation package, which was Musk’s 2012 pay plan. As of yesterday, the pay package was worth US$101.4 billion, according to Equilar, a compensation consulting firm. Musk’s 2018 pay package gave him stock grants worth around 1 per cent of Tesla’s equity each time the company achieved one of 12 tranches of escalating operational and financial goals. Musk did not receive any guaranteed salary. Tornetta argued that shareholders were not told how easily the goals would be achieved when they voted on the package. — Reuters  "
2024-12-04,Intel CEO Gelsinger leaves amid turnaround troubles,https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2024/12/03/intel-ceo-gelsinger-leaves-amid-turnaround-troubles/158720,"NEW YORK, Dec 3 — Intel announced yesterday that CEO Pat Gelsinger has retired effective December 1, as the once dominant chip-making giant company struggles to catch up with rivals. The abrupt departure comes after the company in August vowed to cut more than 15,000 jobs in a draconian cost-reduction plan and paused or delayed construction on several chipmaking facilities. The company named CFO David Zinsner and newly appointed Intel Products CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim co-chief executives while it searches for a permanent successor. Gelsinger, who began his career at Intel in 1979 and served as its first chief technology officer, returned to the company as CEO in 2021 during a critical period for the company. Intel is one of Silicon Valley’s most iconic companies, but its fortunes have been eclipsed by Asian powerhouses TSMC and Samsung which dominate the made-to-order semiconductor business. The company was also caught by surprise with the emergence of Nvidia, a graphics chip maker, as the world’s preeminent AI chip maker. Under Gelsinger’s leadership, Intel invested heavily in semiconductor manufacturing and worked to revitalize its production capabilities, often by relying heavily on government subsidies. US President Joe Biden’s administration last month finalised a US$$7.9 billion (RM35.3 billion) award to Intel as part of his effort of bringing semiconductor production to US shores. But in Europe, Intel last month said it was delaying its plans to build two mega chip-making factories in Germany and Poland as the company faces lower demand than anticipated. Intel also said it would pull back on its projects in Malaysia. “Leading Intel has been the honour of my lifetime,” Gelsinger said in a statement, acknowledging the “challenging year” as the company adapted to market conditions. Zinsner joined Intel in 2022 from Micron Technology, while Holthaus is a nearly 30-year Intel veteran who previously led the company’s Client Computing Group. “We know that we have much more work to do at the company and are committed to restoring investor confidence,” Board chairman Frank Yeary said in the company’s statement. In September, the Wall Street Journal reported that rival Qualcomm had made a takeover approach of embattled Intel, which has a market cap of just over US$100 billion. Intel’s share price yesterday, which has slumped by 50 per cent this year, was up by nearly three per cent on Wall Street. — AFP  "
2024-12-04,Ninja Mart’s first-ever nationwide Spend & Win campaign a commercial success,https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2024/12/03/ninja-marts-first-ever-nationwide-spend-win-campaign-a-commercial-success/158727,"KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 3 — Ninja Mart, the FMCG focused unit by Ninja Van Malaysia, recently concluded its highly successful Spend & Win campaign over the course of three months. As the touchpoint between FMCGs and an extensive network of independent urban and small rural retailers, Ninja Mart conducted this first-ever nationwide campaign to actively engage and give back to the 30,000-plus retailers from the North, Central, and Southern key regions across the country. These regions have been the platform’s firm pillar of support since its launch in 2022. In promoting nationwide and impactful inclusion, its community also encompasses the 200-plus salesmen operating in 14 hubs across the said regions, with the support of four brand sponsors for this campaign. Held between 1 April 2024 and 30 June 2024, the partnership saw brand partners Cricket, Indomie, Yoke Food Industries Sdn Bhd, and Karabao Marketing offering attractive prizes in enticing the accumulation of draw tickets by the retailers throughout the campaign period. As the Spend & Win name suggests, the campaign mechanics involved combining monthly trade marketing mechanics and cashback tier mechanics to increase the retailers’ engagement through ticket collection via the Ninja Mart Cashback app. This automatically enables participation in the Spend & Win lucky draw contest and for retailers to stand a chance of winning up to RM60,000 in prize rewards. As much as the retailers had the opportunity to be rewarded, the brand sponsors too, had the opportunity to gain greater visibility and broader market reach, and played a crucial role in driving over 30,000 retailers’ engagement that contributed towards the campaign’s success. Additionally, the partners benefited from the Sales Facing app that offered them real-time data and insights on store performance, enabling them to track sales trends, make informed decisions, and plan strategically on their investments to maximise growth. Intangible benefits derived were the close ties forged with the 200-strong sales team during their weekly route visit. In terms of Ninja Mart’s key milestones, it successfully engaged over 8,000 retailers, attracted over 300,000 ticket entries, and boarded 6,000 new app users on its Ninja Mart app under its nationwide digitalisation drive especially among the rural retailers. “This campaign is hugely significant as it is about recognising top performing stores as much as it was about fostering stronger relationships between the local teams, retailers, and our brand partners, and ultimately giving back and recognising those who have been a key part of our journey,” says Country Head of Ninja Van, Lin Zheng. “We achieved our objectives and more in the end; besides thanking our brand partners for their generous sponsorship, we are happy that they made some important strides and reaped positive outcomes via this campaign,” Head of Ninja Mart, Malaysia & Vice President of Operations at Ninja Van, Matthew Sequerah Lee. To further drive engagement and boost top-of-mind awareness, various pronged activities were launched alongside creative offline marketing efforts to complement the Spend & Win programme. For the top loyalty stores, the top 200 with the top 10% multi category spent will be enrolled into Ninja Mart’s Komuniti Rewards loyalty programme, while the Salesman Rewards Programme offered additional rewards for the sales force to optimise the campaign uptake. During the Ramadan month of the campaign’s tenure, retailers with purchases of any multi-category products received a Ramadan goodie bag featuring products from the four sponsors. Following the campaign, the winners were announced on livestream via Youtube and the Ninja Mart app in August. The prize-giving ceremony also made history for the first time as Ninja Mart hosted three separate physical events in key regions to celebrate the campaign’s success. The first two prize-giving ceremonies took place on 11 September in Batu Pahat and 12 September in Segamat, Johor while the third ceremony was held on 19 September in Machang, Kelantan. Over 30 attractive prizes were presented, including a Perodua Bezza G (1.0) as the grand prize, a Yamaha Y15ZR motorcycle as a second prize, a Samsung Qled 65-inch 4K television as the third prize, and more. The campaign also entailed monthly-tiered cashback rewards, brand and product level benefits and promotions. Since its founding in 2022, Ninja Mart has supported over 30,000 outlets nationwide, powered by Ninja Van’s logistics technology. The platform offers fulfilment and last-mile delivery services to urban retailers and provides a full end-to-end distribution solution - including van sales and cash handling rural zones - to suburban and rural outlets.

2024-12-04,"Global arms revenues surge on the back of war: Sales hit US$632b in 2023, report reveals",https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2024/12/03/global-arms-revenues-surge-on-the-back-of-war-sales-hit-us632b-in-2023-report-reveals/158655,"STOCKHOLM, Dec 3 — Sales by major arms makers were boosted last year by wars in Ukraine and Gaza and tensions in Asia, with marked increases for manufacturers based in Russia and the Middle East, a report said Monday. Sales of arms and military services by the world’s 100 largest arms companies totalled US$632 billion R(2.8 trillion) in 2023, up 4.2 per cent, according to a report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Revenues had dipped in 2022 as global weapons makers struggled to meet the increase in demand, but many of them managed to increase production last year, the authors of the report noted. In a sign of this surge in demand, all 100 companies tracked achieved sales in excess of US$1 billion last year for the first time. “There was a marked rise in arms revenues in 2023, and this is likely to continue in 2024,” Lorenzo Scarazzato, a researcher with the SIPRI Military Expenditure and Arms Production, said in a statement. Sales from the world’s top 100 arms companies “still did not fully reflect the scale of demand, and many companies have launched recruitment drives, suggesting they are optimistic about future sales,” Scarazzato added. Smaller producers have been more effective in meeting the demand linked to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, growing tensions in East Asia and rearmament programmes in other regions, the institute said. “A lot of them specialise in either a component of something or build systems that require one set of supply chains,” allowing them to react more quickly, Nan Tian, Director of SIPRI’s Military Expenditure and Arms Production Programme, told AFP. Among the leading producers, US companies recorded a 2.5 per cent increase in their sales last year and still account for half the world’s arms revenues, with 41 US weapons producers in the world’s top 100. Lockheed Martin and RTX (formerly Raytheon Technologies), the world’s two largest arms makers, on the other hand, reported a fall in revenue of 1.6 per cent and 1.3 per cent respectively. Such behemoths “often depend on complex, multi-tiered supply chains, which made them vulnerable to lingering supply chain challenges in 2023,” Tian said. Russia’s Rostec surges In Europe, home to 27 of the top 100, arms makers on average saw an increase of just 0.2 per cent. But European groups manufacturing complex weapons systems were still in the process of honouring old contracts last year, so the revenues do not reflect the influx of orders since then.   “At the same time, a number of other European producers saw their arms revenues grow substantially, driven by demand linked to the war in Ukraine, particularly for ammunition, artillery and air defence and land systems,” SIPRI noted. The figures for Russia, though incomplete, give a clear signal of an economy increasingly geared toward war. Sales by the two Russian groups in the ranking rose by 40 per cent, mainly thanks to a 49 per cent increase in sales for state-owned conglomerate Rostec, according to the report. Manufacturers in the Middle East were buoyed by the war in Ukraine and by the first months of the Israeli offensive in Gaza after Hamas’s October 7, 2023 attack — and saw on average an 18 per cent lift in sales. The three Israeli manufacturers in the ranking posted record sales of US$13.6 billion, up 15 per cent from the year before, while the three groups based in Turkey, such as drone producer Baykar, saw their sales jump by 24 per cent — boosted by Ukraine and Turkey’s investments in its defence. In Asia, the trend toward rearmament was particularly evident in the growth in sales by the four South Korean manufacturers, with revenues rising 39 per cent on average, and five Japanese firms that saw an average increase of 35 per cent. The nine Chinese producers meanwhile saw revenue increase by only 0.7 per cent “amid a slowing economy,” but their sales still totalled US$103 billion. — AFP  "

The announcement was made by Johor Menteri Besar Datuk Onn Hafiz Ghazi on his official Facebook yesterday after meeting the former mixed martial arts (MMA) champion in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates together with a state government delegation. “During Khabib’s audience session with Johor Regent Tunku Mahkota Ismail in early October, we discussed youth development programmes and suggestions for opening a training gymnasium in the state. “Through the meeting today, I witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Johor Sports Council (MSNJ) and the undefeated mixed martial artist for the opening of Khabib gym in Johor,” he said. Onn Hafiz hoped that through the collaboration, Johor would continue to progress in home development and be able to open more world-class sports facilities, like those he saw in Abu Dhabi. “I was very impressed to see for myself the world-class facilities available here, including the MMA octagon as well as special spaces for martial arts such as Jiu-Jitsu, Muay Thai, boxing, and wrestling. “In addition, this gymnasium is also equipped with equipment for cardio and weightlifting training. Recovery facilities are also provided, including a sauna and swimming pool which give users the opportunity to achieve the best performance in training,” he said. The 36-year-old Nurmagomedov became well-known when he competed and won in the lightweight division of the UFC. He was the longest-reigning UFC Lightweight Champion, having held the title from April 2018 to March 2021. With a total of 29 wins and no losses, Nurmagomedov retired with an undefeated record. He is widely considered to be among the best in MMA and was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame in 2022."
2024-12-04,"Fifa to reveal Club World Cup draw amid apathy, legal threats",https://www.malaymail.com/news/sports/2024/12/04/fifa-to-reveal-club-world-cup-draw-amid-apathy-legal-threats/158845,"MIAMI, Dec 4 — The draw for the expanded Fifa Club World Cup takes place in Miami today, offering a first glimpse into the fine detail of a tournament that has been viewed with indifference or even outright hostility across parts of the football world. Thirty-two star-studded club teams will battle it out in gleaming state-of-the-art arenas in what is effectively a curtain-raiser for the 2026 World Cup taking place a year later in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In theory, the new-look competition ought to be an enticing prospect that sells itself: a month-long football festival, the first large-scale club tournament to feature teams from all corners of the globe. Yet for many, Fifa president Gianni Infantino’s passion project is a tournament too far, an unwelcome addition to an already crowded global calendar that exhausted players say has pushed them close to breaking point. The loudest antipathy towards the tournament, and Fifa, has come from Europe. In October, an umbrella grouping of top European leagues, together with the players’ union, FIFPro, filed a legal complaint to the European Commission accusing Fifa of abusing its position over its handling of the international fixture calendar. Player frustration Javier Tebas, the chief of Spain’s La Liga, has been one of the Club World Cup’s most outspoken critics, telling Infantino in October to cancel the tournament, citing apathy from broadcasters and opposition from clubs. “Mr President, you know you have not sold the broadcast rights for the Club World Cup, you know you have not sold any sponsorship rights,” said Tebas. “Scrap the Club World Cup. It is not needed by the players, the clubs or Fifa.” Players, meanwhile, have spoken of frustration at an ever-lengthening fixture schedule that leaves them with fewer opportunities for rest and recuperation. Manchester City and Spain star Rodri, the winner of this year’s Ballon d’Or, warned in September that players were “close” to striking over the calendar, citing the demands imposed by this season’s expanded UEFA Champions League followed by the Club World Cup. “If it keeps this way we will have no other option,” Rodri said of possible industrial action. “It is something that worries us.” Fifa though has pushed back at the criticism forcefully, insisting that its calendar was approved by the Fifa Council following consultation from all continents including Europe as well as FIFPro and league bodies. The world football body also took aim at leagues in Europe who have opposed the tournament, accusing them of “acting with commercial self-interest and hypocrisy” while preferring a calendar “filled with friendlies and summer tours.” ‘Something historic’ - Infantino meanwhile has brushed off the criticism, insisting that the launch of the expanded club tournament will usher in a new era for world football. “The Fifa Club World Cup next year will bring the magic of a national team (Fifa) World Cup into the realm of club football, and this tournament will be the start of something historic, something that will change our sport for the better, and for future generations, who will come to love it as much as we do,” Infantino said last month. Yet the opportunity to embrace the historic opportunity touted by Fifa has so far failed to excite broadcasters. Fifa, which is reportedly seeking US$4 billion in media rights revenue for the tournament, has not confirmed a rights deal. The tournament itself will take place from June 15 to July 13, 2025, with the opening match hosted by Miami’s Hard Rock Stadium and the final taking place at the MetLife Stadium in New York—the venue for the 2026 World Cup final. Europe will provide the largest contingent of teams, with 12 sides including Real Madrid, Manchester City, Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan taking part.

2024-12-04,"Van Nistelrooy off to winning start at Leicester, Palace beat Ipswich",https://www.malaymail.com/news/sports/2024/12/04/van-nistelrooy-off-to-winning-start-at-leicester-palace-beat-ipswich/158810,"LEICESTER, Dec 4 — Ruud van Nistelrooy savoured his first match in charge of Leicester with a 3-1 Premier League win over West Ham, while Crystal Palace edged Ipswich 1-0 yesterday. Jamie Vardy, Bilal El Khannouss and Patson Daka got the goals as Van Nistelrooy enjoyed a dream start to his new role shortly after his departure from Manchester United. “On a long-term basis we know the performances need to get better. But the spirit and how we want to do things we saw today because, if not, the Premier League is too brutal,” said Van Nistelrooy. The Dutchman said he had been “astonished” by the number of offers he received after a four-game spell as interim United boss, which included two wins over Leicester. A lethal finisher in his playing days, Van Nistelrooy watched on approvingly as Vardy opened the scoring after just 99 seconds at the King Power. The 37-year-old had initially been flagged offside, but a VAR review showed he was clearly on for his fifth goal of the season. Defeat ramps up the scrutiny of Hammers boss Julen Lopetegui after a seventh defeat in 14 Premier League games. The visitors enjoyed the majority of possession and had 31 shots to Leicester’s eight but failed to make it count. “A frustrating night because we deserved much more today,” said Lopetegui. “Normally we have to win this match but we didn’t because we didn’t score.” West Ham did have a goal controversially ruled out when Leicester goalkeeper Mads Hermansen punched the ball into his own net and was relieved to be awarded a foul due to minimal contact from Tomas Soucek. Conor Coady also cleared off the line from Crysencio Summerville in the second half. But Leicester remained a threat on the counter-attack and doubled their lead when El Khannouss coolly stroked home Kasey McAteer’s pass. Daka then blasted in to make it 3-0 before Niclas Fuellkrug netted a late consolation with his first West Ham goal. Victory lifts Leicester up to 15th, four points above the relegation zone, and within two points of 14th-placed West Ham. Guehi defies FA Jean-Philippe Mateta scored the only goal at Portman Road as Palace won the battle of two more sides at the bottom end of the table. The Frenchman produced a classy finish from Eberechi Eze’s pass on the hour mark to secure the Eagles’ first away win of the season. Palace pull three points clear of the bottom three, while Ipswich remain second from bottom and winless at home on their return to the top flight. However, Palace captain Marc Guehi is now at risk of a suspension after defying a Football Association warning over displaying religious messages. As part of the “Rainbow Laces” campaign to show support for the LGBTQ+ community, Premier League captains are wearing rainbow-coloured armbands. Guehi’s armband bore the message “I love Jesus” during their 1-1 draw against Newcastle, prompting the FA to contact Guehi and Palace and remind them of rules forbidding the display of religious messages. The England defender doubled down on his message with “Jesus loves you” displayed on his rainbow-coloured armband. “Everyone now is about integration, no discrimination and Marc as well,” said Palace boss Oliver Glasner. “He has his opinion and we accept and respect every opinion.” Ipswich captain Sam Morsy, who also caused controversy by opting not to wear the rainbow armband against Nottingham Forest at the weekend, once again wore a regular armband. His club issued a statement on Monday saying he chose not to wear the rainbow armband due to his religious beliefs. — AFP  "
2024-12-04,Milan stroll into Coppa Italia quarter-finals with 6-1 win over Sassuolo,https://www.malaymail.com/news/sports/2024/12/04/milan-stroll-into-coppa-italia-quarter-finals-with-6-1-win-over-sassuolo/158809,"MILAN, Dec 4 — AC Milan made light work of Serie B side Sassuolo with a 6-1 thrashing at the San Siro to reach the quarter-finals of the Coppa Italia yesterday, where Samuel Chukwueze scored two first-half goals. Milan will face the winner of the last 16 tie between AS Roma and Sampdoria. The game was already over as a contest by the 23rd minute after Chukwueze’s brace along with goals from Tijjani Reijnders and Rafael Leao handed Milan a 4-0 lead. Milan added a fifth through Davide Calabria 11 minutes after the interval and after Sassuolo found a consolation goal with Samuele Mulattieri scoring three minutes later, Tammy Abraham rounded off the win in the 61st minute. Chukwueze opened the scoring in the 12th minute when a Reijnders ball over the top put him through one-on-one with the keeper and after his first effort hit the upright he tapped in the rebound. Reijnders drilled a shot home from outside the area five minutes later and Chukwueze netted his second in the 21st minute, curling a shot beyond the reach of the keeper after a Tammy Abraham lay-off. Two minutes later, a no-look pass from Ruben Loftus-Cheek found Leao in the area and he struck a powerful shot low into the far corner. Milan manager Paulo Fonseca’s starting side had eight changes from the team which beat Empoli 3-0 at the weekend, and at the start of the second half he sent on four substitutes. One of those replacements, Christian Pulisic, sent a lofted cross into the box which came off the post and Calabria reacted quickest to convert when the ball came back out. Mulattieri’s shot squirmed under Milan keeper Lorenzo Torriani, another half-time substitute, to finally give Sassuolo something to cheer about, but Abraham finished off the rout, tucking his finish past Sassuolo keeper Giacomo Satalino. Bologna also cruised into the quarter-finals with a 4-0 home win over Monza, with the goals coming from Tommaso Pobega, Riccardo Orsolini, Benjamin Dominguez and Santiago Castro. They await the winners between Atalanta and Cesena. — Reuters  "
2024-12-04,"Three key takeaways from a chaotic Qatar Grand Prix: Verstappen’s revenge, Hamilton’s farewell woes, and FIA turmoil",https://www.malaymail.com/news/sports/2024/12/03/three-key-takeaways-from-a-chaotic-qatar-grand-prix-verstappens-revenge-hamiltons-farewell-woes-and-fia-turmoil/158765,"DOHA, Dec 3 — Max Verstappen added gloss to his status and reputation but left a trail of argument, chaos and tension behind him in the wake of his commanding triumph at the Lusail International Circuit. As the Formula One circus decamps 600km for this week’s season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, after an exhausting run-in to an unprecedented 24-race season, it was clear that Verstappen’s fall-out with George Russell was just one of many issues that surfaced. Here, AFP Sport looks at three things we learned from Sunday’s Qatar Grand Prix: Verstappen motivated by sense of injustice The newly-crowned four-time world champion is a supreme competitor who needs no provocation, but revealed in his driving and post-race revelations that when riled by a sense of injustice he is a formidable force. His ninth win of the season owed much to Red Bull’s brilliance in revising the set-up of his car, but even more to his determination to avenge his overnight loss of pole position following rival Russell’s interventions. The Mercedes driver’s complaint about Verstappen’s slow cooldown lap in Q3 and his behaviour in the stewards’ room resulted in a ruptured relationship, loss of respect and a fierce antipathy. The pair had clashed on Saturday and did again on Sunday morning during the drivers’ pre-race show lap on a trailer when harsh words were exchanged. “He was annoyed with George,” said Red Bull boss Christian Horner. “He carried it into the race. He was super-motivated.” Verstappen’s combination of polished race-craft, natural talent and raw aggressive speed and competitiveness made him unbeatable. He said that he had “completely lost all respect for” Russell and accused the Briton of being “very nice here, in front of the camera, but then when you’re with him inside, as a person, it’s just a different person. And I can’t stand that”. In this mood, he will be a force again in Abu Dhabi where the scrap for the constructors’ championship will be decided with McLaren, hit by a penalty in Doha, leading Ferrari by 21 points. Hamilton not expecting glorious end to Mercedes era Lewis Hamilton endured another grim weekend and made clear he is not expecting a happy ending to his title-laden time with Mercedes. The seven-time champion, who won six of his titles with Mercedes, joins Ferrari next year. On Sunday, he made a false start, picked up a puncture and was penalised for speeding in the pitlane on his way to finishing 12th after the team had persuaded him to continue and not to retire his car. “It could have been worse... I finished. And it is over. It was my fault at the start. The puncture was unfortunate and speeding in the pit lane, that was me there, too. “I don’t think we’re going to end on a high. I think... it will end. What is important is that we turn up, we give it our best shot. “I am grateful I’m still standing. I’m ok. I’ve had great races and bad races in my life... not too many bad ones.” Many may focus on the irony in Hamilton’s subdued return to Abu Dhabi where, in 2021, he missed out on taking an unprecedented eighth drivers’ title in highly controversial circumstances.   Turmoil at ruling body reflected in chaotic race, penalties and unrest The ongoing turmoil at the International Motoring Federation (FIA), where widespread staff upheavals resulted in Rui Marques making his debut as race director, was reflected in a list of severe penalties and curious decisions that created a chaotic race. Most controversial was a 10-second stop-go penalty given to Lando Norris, ruining his chance of an important victory, which led to McLaren requesting a review and much wider criticism. Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff lambasted the FIA, saying: “It could have its own reality show of what’s happening... All our stakeholders need to bear in mind that we need to protect this sport and do it with responsibility, accountability and transparency — and it does not come across like that.” More discordant meetings may add to the rumbling sense of unrest among all involved as the season heads to a climax. — AFP  "
2024-12-04,"A before C? The real reason why Arsenal is above Chelsea in Premier League table, despite their identical records",https://www.malaymail.com/news/sports/2024/12/03/a-before-c-the-real-reason-why-arsenal-is-above-chelsea-in-premier-league-table-despite-their-identical-records/158761,"LONDON, Dec 3 – After 13 matches into the 2024/25 Premier League season, Arsenal and Chelsea share identical match records — but the Gunners sit second while its blue London rivals are in third. Both clubs have 25 points, with seven wins, four draws, and two losses. They have also scored 26 goals and conceded 14. According to Premier League rules, this should mean the teams occupy the same position. So why is Arsenal above Chelsea? To put it simply: Asexplainedby the Premier League, Rule C.7 of the Premier League Handbook states that: “If any two or more Clubs have scored the same number of points, have the same Goal Difference and have scored the same number of goals in League Matches in the Competition during that Season, they shall be deemed to occupy the same position in the League Table”. However, it said that “as with the Premier League table at the start of the season, where all teams have zero matches played, zero points, zero goals scored or conceded, the 20 teams have to be organised in the table through some process and alphabetical order is used”. This explains why Arsenal are ranked above Chelsea. Historically, Arsenal also started the season at the top due to its name, a practice dating back to its decision to change from “The Arsenal” in 1914 (it was previously known as Woolwich Arsenal). However, the situation will be different at the end of the season when final standings are determined — affecting titles, European qualifications, and relegations. Alphabetical order plays no role in this process. Rule C.17 explains that ties are first broken by head-to-head records, followed by away goals in those matches. If teams remain tied, a playoff at a neutral venue is held. Given the current tight standings — with only seven points separating second from 13th — will this season see the league’s first playoff? For now, Arsenal’s historical decision to simplify their name continues to work in their favour, even in the small quirks of the Premier League rankings."

2024-12-04,没去过刘特佐家秘密开会！纳吉：是他与1MDB高层共谋偷钱,https://www.cincainews.com/news/malaysia/2024/12/03/najib-say-he-never-been-to-jho-lows-kia-peng-house/158787,（吉隆坡3日讯）前首相拿督斯里纳吉指出，他不知道也不曾去过在逃富商刘特佐的住家，而刘特佐与一马公司（1MDB）高层频密接触，显示是他们共谋盗取1MDB资金。 纳吉今日在1MDB案自辩时说，他没去过刘特佐位于Kia Peng路的住所，不过根据控方证人证词，1MDB的多位高级管理人员如前总执行长拿督沙鲁、时任内部律师杰思敏、前总财务官阿兹米、哈赞以及他的前助手拿督安哈里，频密前往刘特佐住家。 “这充分表明了，这些人与刘特佐之间的共谋。” 纳吉在回答其辩护律师沙菲宜提问时表示，他是在1MDB审讯中才得知刘特佐曾与这些人会面，他也否认曾使用黑莓手机讯息功能（BBM）与刘特佐及其他人秘密沟通。 沙菲宜：你是否曾通过黑莓手机使用BBM与这个小组秘密联系？纳吉：没有。 此前，沙鲁在庭上表示，刘特佐通过其邮箱[email protected]发送1MDB事务的行动方案至沙鲁的个人邮箱，并通过BBM进一步沟通。此外，如果需要进一步解释，相关会议也会在刘特佐的Kia Peng住所进行，而刘特佐声称这些指示获得了纳吉的授权。 对此，纳吉强调，如果刘特佐确实有其授权，这些会议应在1MDB办公室或首相署举行，而不是在私人住宅中进行。 对1MDB管理及调查的批评 纳吉批评沙鲁等人接受刘特佐指示，并使用私人邮箱处理1MDB重大决策，认为这“不合程序”。“如果沙鲁认为刘特佐的指令是合法且保密的，就应该使用官方邮箱，而不是冒险使用未经授权的个人邮箱。”纳吉补充道，如果这些指示确实获得了他的认可，沙鲁理应将他抄送在邮件中并保存作为证据，但他从未这么做。此外，纳吉表示，他对1MDB所谓的“孤岛作业模式”（work in silo）并不知情，并强调这种模式助长了腐败和欺诈行为。他最后强调，1MDB舞弊案是一场“精心策划的犯罪计划”，完全是刘特佐在操纵，而他对此全然不知。法庭早前宣判纳吉在1MDB案的25项控状全部表罪成立，纳吉现在必须自辩。 纳吉批评沙鲁等人接受刘特佐指示，并使用私人邮箱处理1MDB重大决策，认为这“不合程序”。 “如果沙鲁认为刘特佐的指令是合法且保密的，就应该使用官方邮箱，而不是冒险使用未经授权的个人邮箱。” 纳吉补充道，如果这些指示确实获得了他的认可，沙鲁理应将他抄送在邮件中并保存作为证据，但他从未这么做。 此外，纳吉表示，他对1MDB所谓的“孤岛作业模式”（work in silo）并不知情，并强调这种模式助长了腐败和欺诈行为。 他最后强调，1MDB舞弊案是一场“精心策划的犯罪计划”，完全是刘特佐在操纵，而他对此全然不知。 法庭早前宣判纳吉在1MDB案的25项控状全部表罪成立，纳吉现在必须自辩。
